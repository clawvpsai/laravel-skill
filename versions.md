## Laravel 13 (Latest — July 2026, v13.19.0)

### New in Laravel 13

- **PHP 8.3 minimum required** (8.3, 8.4, 8.5 supported — 8.2 dropped vs Laravel 12)
- **Security fixes until March 17, 2028** (24-month security window per Laravel's policy)
- **Bug fixes until Q3 2027** (~18 months)
- **Laravel AI / Boost MCP** — first-party MCP server for AI assistants
  - `/upgrade-laravel-v13` slash command for automated upgrades
  - Interactive HTML responses in Claude/VS Code Copilot
- **Improved Eloquent** — better attribute casting, faster queries
- **Faster routing** — optimized route resolution
- **Native TypeScript support** — improved scaffolding
- **Laravel Reverb** — first-party WebSocket server (production-ready)
- **New PHP Attributes for Controllers:** `#[Middleware]` and `#[Authorize]`
- **New PHP Attributes for Testing:** `#[Group]`, `#[TestProperty]`, `#[UnitTest]`
- **New PHP Attributes for Queues:** `#[Job]`, `#[Job\Backoff()]`, `#[Job\MaxAttempts()]`, `#[Job\Timeout()]`, `#[Job\FailOnTimeout]`
- **Queue Routing** — `Queue::route()` for centralized queue/connection routing by job class

### New in Laravel 13.17 (June 23, 2026, v13.17.0)

- **Route metadata support** — `Route::metadata([...])` lets you attach arbitrary structured metadata to a route (audit info, feature flags, doc links, internal ownership). Query it back via `Route::getMetadata()` for tooling, dashboard generation, OpenAPI emitters, or to build route inventory reports. PR #60530 by @benbjurstrom.
- **PostgreSQL transaction pooler support** — first-class support for PgBouncer/Postgres pooler transaction mode in `Illuminate\Database\PostgresConnection`. Important when running Laravel behind serverless/edge platforms (Neon, Supabase, AWS RDS Proxy in transaction mode) where persistent connections are forbidden. PR #60425 by @DGarbs51.
- **`ShouldNotRetry` exception handler** — new `Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldNotRetry` interface — when an exception implements it, the queue worker will **fail** the job instead of retrying it, regardless of `$tries` / `maxExceptions`. Use for permanent failures (validation errors, missing records, 4xx upstream errors) that retrying cannot fix. PR #60552 by @alexbowers.
- **`php artisan dev:list` command** — companion to `php artisan dev` (added in 13.16). Lists every dev command registered for the current project (including vendor packages) so you can verify what's going to run before you run `dev`. PR #60573 by @joetannenbaum.
- **`--without-migration-data` flag on `DumpCommand`** — `php artisan schema:dump --without-migration-data` now emits **schema only** (no `INSERT` statements) even when migration data is included. Useful for greenfield DB provisioning or shipping schema files to read replicas. PR #60570 by @jackbayliss.
- **Cache debounce `maxWait` performance fix** — `Cache::flexible()` / `Cache::remember()` with `->debounce(...)->maxWait(...)` no longer re-checks the underlying source on every call when inside the debounce window. Significantly reduces cache hits / DB load for high-frequency debounced keys (rate limiters, hot idempotency keys). PR #60559 by @jackbayliss.
- **`between()` / `unlessBetween()` timezone-independence fix** — these Eloquent query helpers previously depended on the order of `->timezone()` calls. Now timezone conversion is applied per-value, so the order no longer matters. PR #60518 by @ManicardiFrancesco.
- **Clear transaction manager state on disconnect** — fixes leaked transactions / open savepoints that survived a DB disconnect. Prevents phantom "current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block" errors after a failover. PR #60574 by @lazerg.
- **`nightly` framework-install workflow** — new GitHub Actions workflow verifies the framework actually installs cleanly every night (catches regressions in `composer create-project`). PR #60532 by @jackbayliss.

**13.x hardening/cleanup in 13.17:**
- Tightened array-shape typehints where the first parameter is optional (#60553)
- Improved `InteractsWithData::when*` return types (#60536)
- `validateBoolean` / `validateNumeric` now accept `string|int|float` for the validated field type (#60549)
- Missing `@throws \ReflectionException` / `@throws \InvalidArgumentException` annotations on several helpers (#60535, #60546)
- `FileStore` cache deserialization fix for short timestamps (#60543)
- `DevCommands` vendor registration check no longer skips userland frames (#60538)
- `brick/math` 0.18 allowed (#60560)

### New in Laravel 13.18 (June 30, 2026, v13.18.0)

Tagged 2026-06-30 12:55 UTC. **All post-v13.17.0 fixes originally tracked in the previous "Late-June 2026 Bug Fixes" section below shipped together in this release** — there was no v13.17.1. `composer update laravel/framework` is the safe upgrade path; no breaking changes.

**Bug fixes (16 PRs):**

- **`schedule:work` graceful signal handling** — `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`/`SIGQUIT` now stop new runs cleanly and wait for in-flight `schedule:run` subprocesses to finish (was hard-killed mid-task before). Long-lived scheduler processes in Docker/K8s/supervisord no longer need wrapper scripts. PR #60616 (commit ffa562df, 2026-06-28). Covered in `artisan.md` (schedule:work section).
- **`WorkerStopping` event payload** — new public `\$jobsProcessed` (int) and `\$lastJobProcessedAt` (?Carbon) properties; previously only `\$status`/`\$workerOptions`/`\$reason` were public. Enables lifetime-job-count dashboards and graceful-shutdown-gap tracking without reflection hacks. PR #60592 (commit fde9dd43, 2026-06-26) + PR #60608 (ensures `lastJobProcessedAt` is null if nothing was processed). Covered in `queues.md` (WorkerStopping section).
- **Soft-delete `restore()` event gating** — the `restored` model event now fires **only** when the underlying `save()` returns `true`; before, it fired unconditionally even when a `saving` listener cancelled the restore. Sibling change: `restoring` is now gated the same way. PR #60605 (commit eb473d3c, 2026-06-26). Covered in `observers.md`.
- **`HEAD` request cache headers** — `SetCacheHeaders` middleware now applies to `HEAD` (was a 13.16 regression — CDN cache-warming scripts and `link rel="preload"` audits were silently missing `Cache-Control`/`ETag`). PR #60589 (commit a1ecec74, 2026-06-25). Covered in `controllers.md`.
- **`RateLimited` middleware `releaseAfter` `__sleep` fix** — rate-limit release timestamps now serialize through `__sleep()`, so jobs that serialize/unserialize (e.g. via `dispatch($job->afterCommit())`) don't lose their throttle window. PR #60609 (commit a679b90b, 2026-06-27). Listed for awareness — main API unchanged.
- **Conditional return types on several methods** — `Paginator::fragment()`, `Route::domain()`, `Password/File/Email` rule `defaults()`, `__()`, `Lottery::`, `Arr::`, `ComponentAttributeBag::` all narrow return types when the first arg is non-null. PHPStan/Psalm ergonomics. PR #60586 (commit 4eef2ca8, 2026-06-25).
- **Sync getter return types with property generics** — collection / model / builder getters now expose their actual generic types so static analysis can follow `.pluck()` / `->map()` chains into the right element type. PR #60591.
- **`Request::json()` top-level zero body fix** — a literal `0` body was previously coerced to `[]` when read via `Request::json()` or `Request::all()`. Now preserved. PR #60614 (commit 1c0c8fb5, 2026-06-28). Watch the edge case: numeric strings (`"0"`) still come through correctly — the fix only affected numeric `0`. Covered in `api.md` (Error Responses section).
- **`Number::forHumans` / `Number::abbreviate` OOM on `INF` / `NaN`** — these methods previously recursed into `Number::summarize()` without a base case for non-finite inputs and exhausted PHP memory (the process aborted silently — remote-DoS hole on any API response that renders user input through these helpers). Now they delegate to `Number::format()` and emit the locale-aware `∞` / `-∞` / `NaN` symbols. PR #60617 (commit 3a3c1d2b, 2026-06-27). Covered in `performance.md` and `api.md`.
- **`Number::fileSize` wrong unit suffix for non-finite inputs** — sibling fix to the above; `Number::fileSize(INF)` no longer returns a unit-suffixed string for an unbounded value. PR #60625 (commit 7e9d4aa1, 2026-06-29). Same fix pattern, same coverage.
- **`php artisan dev` priority-based registration** — vendor package dev commands can now register a priority so they appear in a deterministic order in `php artisan dev` / `dev:list` output (no breaking change to existing registrations — they just default to a lower priority). PR #60580 (commit 03a7c1a2, 2026-06-23). Useful when a package's "log tail" or "queue worker" should be the first thing the user sees.
- **`php artisan dev --kill-others-on-fail`** — companion flag added in PR #60606. If any registered dev process exits non-zero, sibling processes (server, queue worker, log tail, Vite) are killed immediately instead of leaving zombie workers around. Set this in CI / one-shot dev boxes; leave off for normal local dev where one component dying shouldn't tear everything down.
- **TaggedCache `flexible()` lock + defer label collision fix** — `Cache::flexible()` with a custom `lockName` colliding with a `defer()` label could previously cause the lock to be released under the wrong key. Now both namespaces are namespaced (`flex_lock:` vs `flex_defer:`). PR #60626 (commit 1f95687c, 2026-06-29).
- **Debounced jobs cache-hit reduction** — `Cache::flexible()` / `Cache::remember()` with `->debounce(...)->maxWait(...)` now skips the lock acquisition when already inside the debounce window. Pairs with the 13.17 fix (PR #60559) — together they eliminate a class of "thundering herd on hot debounce keys" symptoms. PR #60575.

**Minor / housekeeping:**
- GitHub Actions group bump (dependabot) — PR #60622.

**Upgrade notes:** No breaking changes vs 13.17. Standard `composer update laravel/framework`. The four most operationally important fixes for production:
1. **`Number::forHumans` / `Number::abbreviate` / `Number::fileSize` INF/NaN guard** (PR #60617 + #60625) — remote-DoS hole on any endpoint rendering user-controllable numerics. **If you can't upgrade yet, see `api.md` DoS section for input-clamping wrap.**
2. **`Request::json()` zero body** (PR #60614) — for `PUT /counters/.../reset` style endpoints with body `0`, drop the `?? 0` workaround after upgrade.
3. **Soft-delete event gating** (PR #60605) — code that assumed `restored` always fired after `restore()` may need to check the boolean return.
4. **HEAD cache headers** (PR #60589) — CDN cache-warming scripts finally get `Cache-Control` / `ETag` on HEAD probes.

**Where each 13.18 feature lives in this skill (cross-references):**
- `schedule:work` signal handling → `artisan.md` (schedule:work section)
- `WorkerStopping` payload + graceful shutdown → `queues.md` (WorkerStopping section)
- Soft-delete `restore()` / `restoring` event gating → `observers.md` (restored callback note)
- HEAD cache headers → `controllers.md` (API Versioning section)
- `Number::forHumans` / `abbreviate` / `fileSize` INF/NaN guard → `performance.md` (Number OOM section) + `api.md` (Number DoS section)

- `php artisan dev` priority + `--kill-others-on-fail` → `artisan.md` (Dev Orchestration section)
- TaggedCache `flexible()` lock/defer namespace fix → `performance.md` (TaggedCache subsection)

### New in Laravel 13.18.1 (July 2, 2026, v13.18.1)

Tagged 2026-07-02 18:36 UTC (two days after 13.18.0). Pure patch release — `composer update laravel/framework` is safe; no breaking changes. Mostly bug fixes and developer-experience improvements, plus one genuinely useful new feature (`Release` queue middleware) and one JSON parsing hardening (`api`/`json` routes respect `Down` maintenance).

**New features (2 PRs):**

- **`Release` queue middleware (`Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\Release`)** — declarative companion to `$this->release()` / `$this->release($delay)`. Attach via `->middleware(new Release($delayInSeconds))` so a job automatically releases itself back to the queue after the middleware runs (without your `handle()` needing to call `release()` manually). Use for "try, and if it would conflict, hand off to another worker" patterns without scattering release calls across every job class. PR #60630 by @mgcodeur. Covered in `queues.md` (Job Middleware section).

- **`input()` method on console commands** — first-class CLI input reader that returns a typed array, parallel to `request()->input()` for HTTP. `$this->input('email')`, `$this->input(['email', 'name'])`, `$this->input()` (all). Cleaner than `$this->argument()` + `$this->option()` + manual casting in every command. PR #60607 by @stevebauman. Covered in `artisan.md` (Defining Commands section).

**Bug fixes (6 PRs):**

- **`assertDatabaseEmpty()` accepts iterables** — previously only worked with table-name strings; passing an Eloquent collection or Builder threw `Argument #1 must be of type string`. Now accepts `string|iterable`. Lets you write `$this->assertDatabaseEmpty(User::all())` or `$this->assertDatabaseEmpty([$tableA, $tableB])`. PR #60621 by @jackbayliss. Covered in `testing.md`.

- **`api` / `json` routes respect `php artisan down` (Maintenance)** — when the app is in maintenance mode with `secret` bypass, `php artisan down --secret=...`, requests to `/api/*` or routes that set `Accept: application/json` were not always gated correctly. Now the `Down` command handles both web and API/JSON routes uniformly — maintenance mode responses return JSON (`{"message": "Service Unavailable", "retry_after": N}`) for API/JSON callers instead of falling through to a 500. PR #60595 by @davidrushton. Covered in `controllers.md` + `deployment.md` (Maintenance section).

- **Channel name respected in `on-demand` log stacks** — `Log::build([...])`/`Log::stack([...])` with `driver: 'errorlog'` or `driver: 'monolog'` on an `on-demand` channel was previously ignoring the configured `channel` name in some callsites (logs landed under the parent's channel). Each channel now writes to its own configured name. PR #60635 by @maltf0. Covered in `logging.md` (Stacked / On-Demand Channels section).

- **Inspect delayed jobs on `Queue::fake()`** — `$this->artisan(...)` test helper plus `Queue::fake()` previously lost delayed-job metadata when inspecting the queue fake after a dispatch (`assertPushed` worked, but `assertReleased`/`assertDelayed` couldn't see delays). Now the queue fake tracks the `availableAt` timestamp so you can assert `$queue->assertPushed(Job::class)->delay(60)`-style inspections. PR #60636 by @jackbayliss. Covered in `testing.md` (Queue Assertions section).

- **`Str::mask()` respects encoding at the end of the string** — when the mask would truncate a multi-byte character at the tail, `Str::mask()` previously chopped the encoding and emitted a partial character (rare display bugs on UTF-8 inputs that hit the mask boundary). Now pads with the encoding-aware character instead. PR #60646 by @iammcoding. Covered in `validation.md` + `security.md` (output encoding section).

- **Predis retry config supports scalars for `config:cache`** — `config/database.php` `redis.options.read_write_timeout` and similar Predis options historically required arrays (so `php artisan config:cache` blew up when you set them to scalar values). Now scalars are accepted and passed through. PR #60642 by @crynobone. Niche — affects Predis users only; PhpRedis unaffected.

**Docblock / type-only fixes (1 PR):**

- **`foreignUuid` / `foreignUlid` Blueprint return types** — `foreignUuid()` / `foreignUlid()` on Blueprint now declare `ColumnType::Uuid` / `ColumnType::Ulid` to match `foreignId()`, so schema-dumpers and migration generators handle them uniformly. No runtime behavior change. PR #60643 by @LiddleDev. Covered in `migrations.md` (Foreign Key Constraints section).

**Upgrade notes:** No breaking changes vs 13.18.0. Drop-in safe to upgrade. The two most useful additions to actually pull from 13.18.1 in your codebase:

1. **`Release` middleware** (PR #60630) — lets you delete a handful of `$this->release(...)` calls scattered across job classes and centralize the release policy in `withMiddleware()` / job default middleware. Worth doing the next time you touch a job that releases itself.
2. **`api`/`json` routes respect `Down`** (PR #60595) — if you've hand-rolled a "maintenance mode" middleware for API routes because the built-in one didn't catch them, you can now delete it.

**Where each 13.18.1 change lives in this skill (cross-references):**
- `Release` queue middleware → `queues.md` (Job Middleware section)
- `input()` on console commands → `artisan.md` (Defining Commands section)
- `assertDatabaseEmpty()` iterable → `testing.md` (Database Assertions section)
- `api`/`json` routes respect `Down` → `controllers.md` (Maintenance section) + `deployment.md` (Maintenance Mode section)
- `on-demand` log stack channel name → `logging.md` (Stacked / On-Demand Channels section)
- Inspect delayed jobs on queue fake → `testing.md` (Queue Assertions section)
- `Str::mask()` encoding-aware tail → `validation.md` (Sanitization Helpers section) + `security.md` (Output Encoding section)
- `foreignUuid`/`foreignUlid` return types → `migrations.md` (Foreign Key Constraints section)
- Predis retry scalar config → `deployment.md` (Redis Configuration section)

### New in Laravel 13.19.0 (July 7, 2026, v13.19.0)

Tagged 2026-07-07 14:14 UTC (five days after 13.18.1). Minor release — `composer update laravel/framework` is the safe upgrade path; no breaking changes. Headline additions are **two new Collection / Stringable helpers** (`reduceInto`, `counted`), **first-class HTTP query helpers** (`Http::query()` + `query`/`queryJson` test assertion helpers), **inspect reserved jobs on the queue fake**, **bulk SQS dispatch via `SendMessageBatch`**, and the **PostgreSQL `whereDate`/`whereTime` Expression fix**.

**New features (5 PRs):**

- **`Collection::reduceInto(callable $reducer, mixed $initial)`** — a faster, more ergonomic alternative to `Collection::reduce()` when you don't care about the carry/initial slot and just want a flat result. Like `Array::reduceInto` it accepts `($carry, $value) => ...` and is generally ~10–20% faster than `reduce()` because the call path skips the empty-initial seeding branch. Pairs with `Collection::reduceMany` (already shipped in 13.15) for a complete aggregation toolkit. PR #60651 by @JosephSilber. Covered in `eloquent.md` (Collection Aggregation section).
- **`Str::counted()` / `Stringable::counted()`** — returns the **character count** (not byte count) of a string, equivalent to `mb_strlen($s)` but on the Str facade. Cleaner than `mb_strlen(Str::of($s))`. PR #60649 by @JosephSilber. Covered in `validation.md` (Sanitization Helpers section) — useful for validating "min/max N characters" rules without bringing `mbstring` directly into the call.
- **`Http::query()` method on the HTTP client** — same shape as `Http::get()` / `Http::post()` but **does not actually send a request**. Returns a `Request` object you can chain assertions on (`->url()`, `->method()`, `->body()`, `->header()`, `->data()`, etc.). Lets you test "did I build this request correctly?" without a fake response. PR #60663 by @shanerbaner82. Covered in `api.md` (HTTP Client section).
- **`query` / `queryJson` HTTP testing helpers** — assertion methods on `TestResponse` and `Http::sent()` callbacks: `$response->assertQuery(['page' => 2])`, `$response->assertQueryMissing('debug')`, `$response->assertQueryJson('items.0.name', 'foo')`. Mirrors the existing `assertJson` / `assertHeader` API for query strings. PR #60662 by @shanerbaner82. Covered in `testing.md` (HTTP Client Testing section).
- **Pop managed queue jobs from cloud-agent instead of SQS** — Laravel Cloud's queue driver now reads from the cloud agent's polling endpoint rather than SQS directly when running on Laravel Cloud infrastructure. Reduces duplicate polling, eliminates a class of "I thought my job was being processed" race conditions, and trims SQS API costs in cloud deployments. PR #60659 by @kieranbrown. Covered in `queues.md` (Cloud Queue section).

**Bug fixes (4 PRs):**

- **`assertSoftDeleted()` / `assertNotSoftDeleted()` accept `deletedAtColumn`** — the soft-delete test assertions previously assumed the default `deleted_at` column. Models that override `getDeletedAtColumn()` (rare but real — multi-tenanted apps, custom naming) had their `assertSoftDeleted` call silently misbehave. Now you can pass `deletedAtColumn: 'archived_at'` and the assertion honors the model's actual column. PR #60657 by @jackbayliss. Covered in `testing.md` (Soft-Delete Assertions section).
- **Bulk SQS jobs via `SendMessageBatch`** — the SQS queue driver historically sent jobs one-by-one (`SendMessage` per job), which costs more API calls and is slower on bulk dispatches. Now groups up to 10 jobs per `SendMessageBatch` call, matching SQS's native batch endpoint. Pairs with the existing `Bus::bulk()` and `Queue::bulk()` API. PR #60645 by @kieranbrown. Covered in `queues.md` (SQS section).
- **Postgres `whereDate` / `whereTime` crash on Expression column** — passing a `DB::raw()` / `Illuminate\Database\Query\Expression` as the column argument previously caused a `column "x" does not exist` error on PostgreSQL because the column-quoting logic tried to quote the expression as if it were an identifier. Now unwraps the Expression and emits the raw SQL. PR #60540 (backported to 12.63.0 as well). Covered in `eloquent.md` (PostgreSQL Gotchas section).
- **Mail config options without `name`** — `config/mail.php` mailers without a `name` key previously failed validation; now mailers without an explicit `name` fall back to the mailer key. PR #60668 by @jackbayliss. Niche; mostly relevant for starter kits and `php artisan install:api` mailer templates.

**Tooling / cleanup (4 PRs):**

- **Pint adds `phpdoc_trim_consecutive_blank_line_separation` rule** — `vendor/bin/pint` now trims consecutive blank lines in PHPDoc blocks. PR #60669 by @lucasmichot.
- **Remove deprecated `StaticCallOnNonStaticToInstanceCallRector` Rector rule** — was deprecated in Rector 2.x; the bundled config no longer ships it. PR #60670 by @lucasmichot.
- **Tests for relative date where clauses** — formal coverage for `whereDate('created_at', '>=', '-7 days')` style calls. PR #60675 by @aligulzar729.
- **Tests for date rule's `past()` / `future()` / `nowOrPast()` / `nowOrFuture()` methods** — new `DateRule::past()`, `DateRule::future()`, `DateRule::nowOrPast()`, `DateRule::nowOrFuture()` helpers on the date validation rule (separate from the `after` / `before` rules) for clearer intent. PR #60687 by @aligulzar729. Covered in `validation.md` (Date Rules section).

**Where each 13.19.0 change lives in this skill (cross-references):**
- `Collection::reduceInto` → `eloquent.md` (Collection Aggregation section)
- `Str::counted()` / `Stringable::counted()` → `validation.md` (Sanitization Helpers section)
- `Http::query()` HTTP client method → `api.md` (HTTP Client section)
- `query` / `queryJson` HTTP testing helpers → `testing.md` (HTTP Client Testing section)

- Postgres `whereDate` / `whereTime` Expression fix → `eloquent.md` (PostgreSQL Gotchas section)
- `DateRule::past()` / `future()` / `nowOrPast()` / `nowOrFuture()` → `validation.md` (Date Rules section)

**Upgrade notes:** No breaking changes vs 13.18.1. Drop-in safe to upgrade. The three most useful additions to actually pull from 13.19.0 in your codebase:

1. **`Http::query()`** (PR #60663) — if you've been writing `Http::fake([...])` just to assert "did I build the right URL?", you can now write a non-sending test that just inspects the request. Pair with `assertQuery()` for query-string assertion coverage that didn't exist before.
2. **Bulk SQS via `SendMessageBatch`** (PR #60645) — if you dispatch jobs in bulk and your queue is SQS, you get a free 10x API call reduction. No code change required; just upgrade.
3. **`Collection::reduceInto`** (PR #60651) — drop-in replacement for `Collection::reduce(fn($c, $v) => ..., $init)` where you don't read `$c` in the reducer body. Strictly faster.

### New in Laravel 13.16 (June 16, 2026, v13.16.0 — patch v13.16.1)

- **`php artisan dev` command** — new first-party dev orchestration command. Runs server, queue worker, log tailing, and Vite concurrently — replaces per-project `composer dev` scripts. Configure via `Illuminate\Foundation\Console\DevCommands`. Package-aware (vendor packages are skipped). Auto-detects Node package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun). **Upgrade to v13.16.1** which fixes a registration bug.
- **`whenFilledEnum()` request helper** — `Request` now has `$request->whenFilledEnum('status', Status::class, fn(Status $s) => ...)` — combines `whenFilled()` + `tryFrom()` + null guard in one call. Invalid enum values silently skip the callback (no throw). Optional default callback runs when the primary callback doesn't.
- **`withCookies()` on all responses** — promoted from `RedirectResponse` to `ResponseTrait`. Attach multiple cookies to any response type (`JsonResponse`, standard `Response`) in a single call: `response()->json($data)->withCookies([$cookieA, $cookieB])`. Additive, non-breaking.
- **`array` maintenance mode driver** — new `array` driver joins `file` and `cache`. Designed for **parallel testing** where file driver + `Cache` facade mocking can break tests that call `php artisan up`/`down`. Set `APP_MAINTENANCE_DRIVER=array` in `.env.testing`.
- **`anyOf` JSON Schema support** — `JsonSchema` now supports `anyOf` and multi-type unions. Deserializer is hardened against unbounded `$ref` expansion (prevents recursion attacks).
- **Enums in `broadcastAs()`** — broadcast events can return an enum from `broadcastAs()` for the event name; pairs with typed SDK generators so client/server event names stay in sync.
- **Queue attributes on traits** — `#[Job]`, `#[Tries]`, `#[Backoff]`, `#[Timeout]`, `#[FailOnTimeout]`, `#[DebounceFor]` attributes now work on traits used by jobs (not just on job classes directly).
- **`Batchable::batching` finished-batch fix** — fixed crash when accessing `Batchable::batching` after a batch has finished.
- **HTTP client serialization hardening** — request and fake-response serialization is now hardened against malicious input.
- **Improved return types** — generic types added to `WorkerIdle`, `WorkerLooping`, `listenForSignals`, model scope callbacks, connection callbacks, and `DatabaseTransactionsManager` getters for better static analysis.

**Patch highlights (v13.16.1):** Fixes a bug where `DevCommands` could stop itself from registering when packages attempted to register commands. Always upgrade to 13.16.1 over 13.16.0.

### New in Laravel 13.15 (June 9, 2026, v13.15.0)

- **Typed translation accessors** — `trans()->string($key)` and `trans()->array($key)` return concrete `string` / `array` types instead of `array|string|null`. Mirrors the typed helpers like `config()` and `request()` — improves static analysis and IDE inference. Available on both `trans()` and `__()` helpers.
- **`JsonSchema::fromArray()` deserializer** — turn a raw JSON Schema array back into `Type` objects (inverse of serialization). Pairs with multi-type union support in the schema builder.
- **Dedicated Cloud queue driver (deepened)** — Laravel Cloud's managed queue driver is now a first-class connection. Several changes land together:
  - Managed queues boot **before** service providers (jobs ready before app boots)
  - Throws `ManagedQueueNotFoundException` when a configured managed queue is missing
  - FIFO queue name normalization corrected
  - Request ID header renamed `X-Request-ID` → `Cloud-Request-ID` and now emitted into logs for distributed tracing
- **Enums in `Queue::route()`** — pass enum cases for both queue and connection when routing jobs: `Queue::route(Job::class, connection: MyQueue::Redis, queue: QueueName::Emails)` instead of strings.
- **`Prohibitable` on `cache:clear` and `queue:flush`** — both commands now respect the `Prohibitable` interface (already added to `queue:clear`, `config:clear`, `key:generate`).
- **`Macroable` on `InvokedProcess`** — add macros to `InvokedProcess` for custom subprocess behavior.
- **`Cache::rememberWithWarmth()`** — `Cache::remember()`'s stateful twin. Returns `array{value, bool}` where the bool indicates whether the value came from the cache. Lets you log cache-hit/miss, set `X-Cache` headers, or skip expensive post-processing on a cache hit — without a separate `Cache::has()` round trip. `Cache::remember()` is now a thin wrapper around this. (PR #60385)
- **`queue:failed` real class name** — fixed bug where `php artisan queue:failed` displayed the wrapped/obfuscated class name instead of the real job class.
- **Compiled Blade views not left expired** — fixed bug where unchanged compiled Blade views were unnecessarily treated as expired.
- **Number helper fixes** — `Number::fileSize()` handles negative byte values; `Number::trim()` no longer returns null for `INF`/`NAN`; `Number::pairs()` no longer infinite-loops on negative step and throws on zero step.
- **Generics on queue routes** — `QueueRoutes::all()` is now properly typed.

**Security fixes in v13.15.0:**
- **`date_equals` validation bypass** — the `date_equals` rule used loose comparison, so invalid date strings parsing to `null` could pass against reference dates parsing to falsy values (e.g., `1970-01-01`). Fixed by using strict equality for the equal operator while keeping loose comparison for legitimate `DateTime` objects. **Upgrade critical for apps exposing `date_equals` to untrusted input.**
- **Restricted route unserialization** — route caching/resolution unserialization now restricts accepted classes, reducing object-injection surface during route loading.

**Other fixes:** Infinite recursion when a model scope is defined with a private attribute; infinite recursion when a middleware group references itself; FIFO normalization in Cloud managed queues.

### New in Laravel 13.14 (June 2026, v13.14.0)


- **Lazy refresh hook on all connections** — database connections now register a lazy refresh hook that resets stale connections automatically on use, improving reliability in long-running workers
- **Cache falsy JSON payloads in HTTP client** — falsy values (null, false, 0, "") are now cached in HTTP client JSON responses. Previously `null` responses were not cached at all
- **`Request::createFromBase()` Symfony 8.1 compatibility** — fixed compatibility issue when creating Request objects from Symfony 8.1 Request instances
- **`Message::embed` data attachment fix** — fixed handling of data attachment URLs in mail message embedding, correcting email rendering issues
- **Cloud logging formatter namespaced** — CloudLogFormatter is now properly namespaced, fixing cloud deployment logging issues
- **Child queue properties over inherited attributes** — when a job extends another job class, child job properties now correctly take precedence over parent class attributes (e.g., $tries, $timeout) instead of being overwritten
- **JSON Schema array deserializer** — new `arrayDeserializer` for JSON Schema validation, allowing proper deserialization of array-typed fields from JSON Schema definitions
- **`InspectedJob` queue name** — InspectedJob now carries the queue name, improving job observability and debugging in cloud queue workers
- **`#[DebounceFor]` units parameter** — the `#[DebounceFor]` queue attribute now supports explicit time units: `#[DebounceFor(30, 'seconds')]`, `#[DebounceFor(2, 'minutes')]`, etc.
- **Null header handling fix** — fixed crash when HTTP headers contain null values in the Header class

**Patch release highlights:** v13.14.0 is primarily a bug-fix and compatibility release:
- Child queue job property inheritance fix (queues using base classes)
- Falsy HTTP response caching (reduces redundant API calls)
- Lazy refresh hook (fewer stale DB connection errors in workers)

### New in Laravel 13.13 (June 2026, v13.13.0)

- **MariaDB Vector Index support** — new vector index capability for AI/embeddings workloads directly in migrations: `$table->vectorIndex(['embedding'], 'vector_index', 'vector_length:1536)` (requires MariaDB with vector support)
- **`Bus::bulk()`** — new method for dispatching multiple jobs at once with a single call. Useful for batch processing: `Bus::bulk([new ProcessItem(1), new ProcessItem(2), new ProcessItem(3)])`
- **`Cache` attribute memoization** — `#[Cache(ttl: 300)]` now supports memoization — the callback is only executed once and the result is cached for subsequent calls within the same request
- **`Http::asPsrClient()`** — HTTP facade now implements `Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface`, allowing Laravel's Http client to be used as a drop-in PSR-18 client
- **`attachFromStorage` for Mailables** — `MailMessage::attachFromStorage()` convenience method for attaching files from Laravel storage disks to notifications/mails
- **`InspectedJob` payload** — queue jobs can now carry an arbitrary payload array via `InspectedJob`, useful for observability and debugging
- **Cloud managed queue FIFO fix** — fixed FIFO name normalization in Cloud managed queues (backported from 13.11 fix)
- **SQL Server unique constraint error handling** — `isUniqueConstraintError()` now catches SQL Server error 2627
- **`whereDate`/`whereTime` crash fix** — fixed crash when `$column` is a `Query\Expression`
- **`assertJsonPathsCanonicalizing`** — new `TestResponse` assertion: `$response->assertJsonPathsCanonicalizing($paths)` for order-independent JSON comparison
- **`Str::studly()`/`Str::pascal()` normalize parameter** — both methods now accept `normalize: true` to strip non-alphanumeric chars before casing: `Str::studly('hello-world_test', normalize: true)` → `HelloWorldTest`
- **Image dimension validation operator fix** — fixed inverted ratio comparison in dimension validation rules
- **Scheduler opt-out of pause/interrupt cache** — scheduled tasks can now opt out of worker pause and interrupt cache checks via attribute
- **Event skipping indication** — events can now signal they were intentionally skipped in listeners
- **`UniqueFor` hint unit** — improved type hinting for `UniqueFor` validation rule

### New in Laravel 13.12 (May 2026, v13.12.0)

- **Worker restart on lost connection opt-out** — queue workers can now be configured to NOT restart on lost database/Redis connection via `Queue::preventWorkerRestartOnLostConnection()`
- **Scheduler attributes** — `Schedule` now supports custom attributes for grouping/organizing scheduled tasks: `->attributes(['group' => 'critical'])`
- **`Str::studly()`/`Str::pascal()` normalize parameter** — see v13.13 entry above (same feature, noted in both releases)
- **`assertJsonPathsCanonicalizing`** — see v13.13 entry above
- **`queue:clear` default param null** — `queue:clear` command now defaults `driver` param to `null` instead of requiring explicit driver argument
- **Scheduler callback parameter resolution** — scheduled event callbacks are now resolved by type rather than parameter name, fixing edge cases with DI
- **`compact()` removal** — all remaining `compact()` calls in framework replaced with explicit arrays (compatibility with PHP 8.4)
- **SQLite `file:` prefix URI support** — SQLite connections now support `file:` prefix in DSN: `sqlite://file:/path/to/database`
- **ClearCommand prohibitable** — `queue:clear`, `cache:clear`, `config:clear` now implement `Prohibitable` interface
- **Auto-discovered listeners opt-out** — event listeners can opt out of auto-discovery via `#[Discoverable(enabled: false)]`
- **`Up`/`Down` commands exception reporting** — `php artisan up` and `php artisan down` now properly report exceptions instead of silently failing
- **`Number::spell()` type fix** — fixed incorrect `@return` types in `Number::spell()`, `ordinal()`, and `spellOrdinal()`
- **Async HTTP retries with array backoff** — async HTTP client retries now work correctly with array backoff values like `[1, 5, 10]`
- **PSR-7 multipart array handling** — fixed multipart/form-data handling for PSR-7 responses
- **`Optional::offsetUnset()` docblock** — fixed incorrect docblock type hint
- **`factory()->pivot()` stub** — new `factory()->pivot()` method generates pivot table model factories
- **`KeyGenerateCommand` prohibited** — `php artisan key:generate` now respects the `Prohibitable` interface

### New in Laravel 13.11 (May 2026, v13.11.2)

- **Dedicated Cloud Queue** — new `Illuminate\Foundation\Cloud\Queue` decorator wraps any queue driver (Redis, SQS, etc.) with cloud-native instrumentation. Tracks currently processing job, job start timestamps, and dispatches cloud-specific events. Use via the `cloud` queue connection.
- **Cloud-Request-ID in logs** — `Cloud-Request-ID` header value is automatically written to log entries for request tracing across services.
- **Boot managed queues before service providers** — cloud queue service providers now boot before application service providers, ensuring queue workers are ready before the app starts processing jobs.
- **Lifecycle deferred event method fixes** — fixed edge cases in event deferral for cloud queue lifecycle events.

### New in Laravel 13.10 (May 2026, v13.10.0)

- **WorkerIdle event** — new `WorkerIdle` event dispatched when the queue worker has no jobs to process. Useful for cleanup, metrics, or scaling down workers. Receives `WorkerOptions`.
- **assertPushedOnce()** — new `Queue::assertPushedOnce()` assertion to verify a job was pushed exactly once (alias for `assertPushed($job)` with exactly 1 call count).
- **starts_with/ends_with accept numeric values** — `starts_with` and `ends_with` validation rules now correctly accept numeric (integer/float) input values.
- **Validate line breaks in emails** — email validation now rejects values containing line breaks (potential email header injection).

- **Cloud-Request-ID header** — request tracking header renamed from `X-Request-ID` to `Cloud-Request-ID` for clarity in cloud deployments.

### New in Laravel 13.9 (May 2026)

- **PreparesForDispatch interface for Jobs** — new `PreparesForDispatch` interface lets jobs execute preparation logic before being dispatched to the queue. Useful for validation, enrichment, or state checks that run synchronously at dispatch time rather than async in handle().
- **PendingDispatch conditionable** — `PendingDispatch` now supports `->when()` and `->unless()` conditionals for cleaner conditional dispatch logic.
- **Migration events with name** — `MigrationStarted` and `MigrationEnded` events now carry the migration name for more granular event handling.
- **Generic return types on Builder paginate** — `paginate()`, `simplePaginate()`, `cursorPaginate()` now return properly typed `LengthAwarePaginator`/`Paginator` instances.
- **Queue:pause error display** — `php artisan queue:pause` now shows a clear error when the Worker is not pausable.
- **ThrottlesExceptions Closure support** — `ThrottlesExceptions` middleware now accepts a Closure for dynamic, exception-type-aware rate limiting.

- Internal: `mt_rand()` replaces `rand()`, `preg_split` replaces `mb_split`, PSR-7 multipart array handling fixed.

### New in Laravel 13.8 (May 2026)

- **DatabaseLock excludes expired locks** — `DatabaseLock::isLock` now properly excludes expired locks when checking ownership, fixing race conditions in lock cleanup
- **Worker Pausing/Resuming events** — new `WorkerPausing` and `WorkerResuming` events dispatched by queue workers
- **assertSessionMissingInput** — new TestResponse assertion to verify old input is NOT present in session after form submission

- **schedule:list environment filter** — `php artisan schedule:list --environment=production` filters output by environment
- **Collection min/max generic result type** — `Collection::min()`/`max()` now return `T|null` instead of `mixed`
- **All queue inspection methods** — new `allPushed()`, `allNotPushed()`, `allPushedOn()` methods on QueueFake for batch assertions
- **SortDirection enum** — `Illuminate\Database\Query\SortDirection` provides type-safe `Ascending`/`Descending` for `orderBy()` instead of string `'asc'`/`'desc'`

### New in Laravel 13.7 (April 2026)

- **Debounceable Queued Jobs** — `#[DebounceFor]` attribute keeps only the last dispatch within a time window. Eliminates redundant processing from bursty workloads (e.g., user edits same doc 10x in 30s → 1 rebuild instead of 10).
- **JSON support for health route** — `/up` health endpoint now supports returning JSON response data for richer health status
- **JsonFormatter** — native `Monolog\Formatter\JsonFormatter` support for structured JSON log output
- **Cloudflare Email Service support** — new mail driver integration for Cloudflare's email routing
- **@fonts Blade directive** — `@fonts` generates `<link rel="preload">` tags for Vite-managed fonts, improving Core Web Vitals

### New in Laravel 13.5 (Late April 2026)

- Queue infrastructure maturity improvements across v13.3 through v13.6 releases

## Laravel 12 (February 2025, v12.62.0)

### New in Laravel 12

- **Application Starter Kits** — React, Svelte, Vue, and Livewire with Shadcn components
- **PHP 8.2 minimum required** — supports 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
- **Bootstrap 5 by default** — no more Bootstrap 4
- **Vite as default bundler** — Laravel Mix officially deprecated
- **Health endpoint at `/up`** — built into framework, no route needed
- **`php artisan serve` accepts `--host` and `--port`** natively
- **`Queue::after()` and `Queue::failure()` methods** — cleaner queue events
- **Per-second rate limiting** — `RateLimiter::for('api', ...)` supports `perSecond()`
- **`Str::stripTags()`** — better than `strip_tags()`
- **Laravel Reverb** — first-party WebSocket server

### Breaking Changes from 11

- `bootstrap/app.php` no longer registers all service providers by default
- `config/app.php` no longer has `aliases` array
- Route middleware registered in `bootstrap/app.php` via `$middleware->`
- `App\Http\Kernel` and `App\Console\Kernel` fully removed

### Laravel 12 Latest Patch (v12.62.0 — June 9, 2026)

v12.62.0 is a **patch release** — contains bug fixes and features backported from Laravel 13, no new breaking features:
- **`JsonSchema::fromArray()` deserializer (backport from 13.15)** — turn a raw JSON Schema array back into `Type` objects. Pairs with the new multi-type union support.
- **Multi-type union support in `JsonSchema` (backport from 13.15)** — `Illuminate\JsonSchema` now supports `anyOf` and multi-type unions.
- **PostgreSQL `compileColumns()` performance fix (backport from 13.15)** — skips `pg_collation` lookup on PostgreSQL < 9.1.
- **Cloud queue support (backport from 13.11.2)** — managed queues boot before service providers; `ManagedQueueNotFoundException` thrown when missing; FIFO name normalization corrected.
- **HTTP attach empty contents preserved (backport from 13.15)** — `GrahamCampbell` fix that prevents empty attachment bodies from being dropped.
- **`Number` helper fixes (backport from 13.15)** — `Number::trim()` no longer returns null for INF/NAN; `Number::pairs()` no longer infinite-loops when `$by <= 0`; `Number::fileSize()` handles negative byte values.
- **LocalFilesystemAdapter path separators (backport from 13.15)** — separators are no longer encoded in the Local adapter.
- **Env parser regex fix (backport from 13.15)** — `Env::addVariableToEnvContents` quoting fix.
- **Deprecation logging fix (backport from 13.15)** — `config` is now bound before logging the deprecation notice.
- **queue:failed real class name (backport from 13.15)** — `clementmas` fix so the command shows the actual job class instead of an alias.
- **SQS / Cloud queue name normalization** — FIFO queue names normalized correctly.
- **No new features beyond backports** — purely maintenance

---

### Laravel 12 Latest Patch (v12.63.0 — July 7, 2026)

v12.63.0 is a **patch release** — bug fixes backported from Laravel 13, no new breaking features. Tagged 2026-07-07 14:17 UTC (28 days after v12.62.0, two minutes after v13.19.0).

- **PostgreSQL `whereDate` / `whereTime` Expression crash fix (backport, PR #60540)** — same fix as 13.19.0. Passing `DB::raw()` / `Expression` as the column argument previously crashed with `column "x" does not exist` on PostgreSQL. Now unwraps the Expression. Critical for 12.x apps using raw expressions in date queries.
- **New error messages for lost-connection detection (PR #60472 by @mfn)** — PostgreSQL connection drops (network blip, RDS failover, PgBouncer restart) previously surfaced as generic "could not connect" errors. New error class names + messages distinguish "lost connection mid-query" from "never connected" — the latter is the most common cause of spurious `SQLSTATE[08006]` errors during deploys. No runtime API change.
- **Cache lock refresh (PR #58349 by @bytestream)** — `Cache::lock($name)->refresh()` now properly extends a held lock's TTL. Previously, calling `refresh()` on a lock you already held either no-op'd or returned a stale state depending on driver. The new behavior matches Redis `PEXPIRE` semantics: "extend my held lock, but only if I still own it." Useful for long-running jobs that need to renew their distributed lock without releasing and re-acquiring.
- **Pop managed queue jobs from cloud-agent instead of SQS (PR #60660)** — same change as 13.19.0's #60659, backported.
- **`ComponentAttributeBag::merge()` default-style semicolon (PR #60665 by @Amirhf1)** — when `merge()` synthesizes a default `style` attribute from existing attributes, the generated CSS now ends with `;`. Before: browsers would silently drop the last declaration if a user added a custom `style="color:red"` without a trailing semicolon. Cosmetic CSS-only fix.

**Upgrade notes:** Safe to upgrade from 12.62.0. The cache-lock refresh is the most useful backport — if you've ever hand-rolled `Cache::lock()->block()` with a manual `sleep + refresh` loop, you can simplify it.

## Laravel 11 (2024)

### New in Laravel 11

- **Application skeleton cleaned** — far less boilerplate
- **`bootstrap/app.php`** replaces `Kernel.php` for middleware registration

### New in Laravel 10

- **PHP 8.1 minimum required**
- **`Illuminate/Validation/Rules/ProhibitedBy`**

---

## Version-Agnostic Best Practices (Always Apply)

### Always Use

- PHP 8.3+ (Laravel 13 requires 8.3+, optimized for 8.4)
- Composer 2.x
- Vite (not Mix — Mix deprecated in 11+)
- SQLite for local dev (zero config)
- `php artisan key:generate` on fresh install
- `assertSuccessful()` not `assertStatus(200)` in tests

### Deprecation Timeline

| Feature | Deprecated In | Removed In |
|---|---|---|
| Laravel Mix | 11 (use Vite) | 12 |
| `assertStatus()` | 10 | 13 |
| `php artisan make:model -mcr` shorthand | Still works | — |
| `App\Http\Kernel` removed | 11 | 12 |
| `App\Console\Kernel` removed | 11 | 12 |
| `config/app.php` aliases array | 11 | 12 |
| PHP 8.0/8.1/8.2 support | 13 | — |
| Bootstrap 4 default | 12 | — |

### Version Detection

## Ecosystem Update (2026-06-28, cycle 5)

### Slow JSON Stream DoS Disclosure — Tier 1 for Laravel

PHP/Laravel is now flagged as **Tier 1 (CVSS 7.5 HIGH)** in the cr0hn "Slow JSON Stream" DoS research (June 27, 2026). No framework version update mitigates this — the fix is at the deployment layer (nginx `client_body_timeout` + `client_min_rate` + PHP-FPM `request_terminate_timeout`). See `security.md` for the full mitigation playbook.

### No New Framework Version (Laravel 13.17.0 still latest)

As of June 28, 2026, Laravel framework **v13.17.0** (June 23, 2026) remains the latest. Laravel 13.18 has not been released yet. Track [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases) for the next tag.


### Ecosystem Update (2026-06-28, cycle 7) — HISTORY (Laravel 13.17.0 was latest at this point)

#### No new Laravel framework version

Laravel framework **v13.17.0** (June 23, 2026) remains the latest stable as of 2026-06-28 12:00 UTC. v13.18 has not been tagged yet. Track [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases) for the next release.

#### New CVEs in the Laravel ecosystem (cycle 7)

- **CVE-2026-45793** (Composer, May 13, 2026, CVSS 7.5 HIGH) — GitHub `GITHUB_TOKEN` and GitHub App installation tokens leaked in plaintext to CI logs when their new hyphenated format failed Composer's legacy validation regex. Fixed in **Composer 2.9.8 / 2.2.28 / 1.10.28**. If you ran affected versions in CI, **rotate tokens immediately**. See `security.md` for the full mitigation playbook.
- **CVE-2026-40261** (Composer Perforce, April 15, 2026) — command injection in `Perforce::syncCodeBase()`. Exploitable even when not using Perforce (source-driver loaded on demand). Fixed in Composer 2.9.6 / 2.2.27.
- **CVE-2026-40176** (Composer Perforce, April 15, 2026) — command injection in `Perforce::generateP4Command()` via malicious root `composer.json` Perforce params. Fixed in Composer 2.9.6 / 2.2.27.
- **CVE-2026-54244** (Statamic, June 26, 2026) — Live Preview authorization bypass allowing read-only CP users to submit content updates. Patch pending at time of writing; watch the [Statamic releases feed](https://github.com/statamic/cms/releases). See `security.md`.

#### Composer version recommendations (updated cycle 7)

- **Composer 2.9.8+** (mainline) — required for CVE-2026-45793, CVE-2026-40261, CVE-2026-40176 fixes
- **Composer 2.2.28+** (LTS line) — required for same fixes on LTS track
- **Composer 1.10.28+** — final patch on the Composer 1.x line (consider migrating to 2.x; 1.x is EOL for new features)


### Ecosystem Update (2026-06-28, cycle 8) — HISTORY (Laravel 13.17.0 was latest at this point)

#### No new Laravel framework version

Laravel framework **v13.17.0** (June 23, 2026) remains the latest stable as of 2026-06-28 18:00 UTC. v13.18 has not been tagged yet. Track [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases) for the next release.

#### Skill maintenance pass — oldest topic files refreshed

No new CVEs found this cycle (the four cycle-7 CVEs — Composer 45793/40261/40176 + Statamic 54244 — remain the most pressing). Instead, refreshed four topic files that hadn't been touched since May 25 (34+ days), filling documented-but-skipped feature gaps:

- **`observers.md`** (cycle 5 → cycle 8) — added `#[Boot]` and `#[Initialize]` model lifecycle attribute section. These PHP attributes have shipped since Laravel 11 but were missing from the skill. Lets you hang lifecycle logic off individual model methods without overriding `boot()` or wrapping in an observer. Also added `#[Scope]` for inline local-scope methods.
- **`validation.md`** (cycle 5 → cycle 8) — added `#[FailOnUnknownFields]` attribute for Form Requests (Laravel 13+, defense-in-depth against mass-assignment probing / unknown-field leakage). Added `Password::toPasswordRulesString()` (Laravel 13.9+) for the JS hint string consumed by browser password managers via the `passwordrules` HTML attribute.
- **`logging.md`** (cycle 5 → cycle 8) — added full `Context` facade section. Replaces the older `Log::shareContext()` pattern with the documented public API: `Context::add()`, `addIf()`, `push()`, `all()`, `forget()`, `flush()`, plus `addHidden()` for context that survives the queue boundary but is excluded from log output (PII, tokens).
- **`auth.md`** (cycle 5 → cycle 8) — added Laravel 13 starter-kit + Fortify integration section showing how to enable passkeys in a single feature flag (`Features::passkeyAuthentication()` / `Features::passkeyRegistration()`) without writing WebAuthn boilerplate. Includes passkey recovery guidance (always keep email + password fallback).

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.19.1** (cycle-8 maintenance, no new framework version).

### Ecosystem Update (2026-06-30, cycle 15)

#### No new Laravel framework version (at cycle start)

At the start of the cycle-15 window (~18:00 UTC 2026-06-30), Laravel framework **v13.17.0** (June 23, 2026) was still the latest stable. **However, v13.18.0 was tagged at 2026-06-30 12:55 UTC** — five hours before this cycle ran. The cycle-15 entry was written before that tag was noticed; the v13.18.0 work is now incorporated in the **"New in Laravel 13.18"** section above (and superseded by cycle 16 which does the full version-refresh).

#### No new framework CVEs

CISA SB26-180 (week of June 22, 2026) and the Laravel-specific OpenCVE feed were both rechecked at 18:00 UTC. No new framework-level CVEs in the last 6 hours. The Filament MFA recovery-code reuse (SB26-180) and CVE-2026-39976 Laravel Passport (already documented in `security.md`) remain the highest-priority Laravel-ecosystem items.

#### Skill maintenance pass — oldest untouched files refreshed

No new framework version at cycle-time, no new CVEs. Targeted the two oldest topic files (both 3+ days stale) with feature gaps that AI models keep getting wrong:

- **`migrations.md`** (cycle 5 → cycle 15) — added `storedAs()` / `virtualAs()` generated columns (MySQL/MariaDB support both STORED and VIRTUAL; PostgreSQL/SQLite STORED only), PostgreSQL `generatedAs()` identity columns (SQL-standard `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`, the modern replacement for `SERIAL`), `->comment('text')` column modifier, and the full index type matrix (`fullText()` with optional `->language('english')` on PG, `spatialIndex()` on MySQL/MariaDB). Critical because AI models frequently misuse `generatedAs()` for string concatenation (it only works on `smallint`/`integer`/`bigint` sequences) — clarified the gotcha.
- **`file-uploads.md`** (cycle 5 → cycle 15) — fixed the `Storage::temporaryUploadUrl()` example to use the Laravel 13.x array-destructure return (`['url' => $url, 'headers' => $headers]`) and document the mandatory header-forwarding; added a File Visibility section covering the `public` / `private` model, the `setVisibility()` metadata-vs-re-upload gotcha, and R2 specifics; added an anti-extension-spoofing section covering the `evil.php.jpg` attack and the layered defense (never trust original filename, validate with `finfo` on actual file bytes, pair Laravel's `mimes:` with `file|image`, disable PHP execution in upload dirs, sanitize SVGs, strip EXIF).

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.3** (cycle-15 maintenance, no new framework version). 15 cycles in last 3 days.

### Ecosystem Update (2026-07-01, cycle 16)

#### Laravel 13.18.0 released 2026-06-30 12:55 UTC — incorporated in this cycle

v13.18.0 was tagged ~11 hours before this cycle ran (June 30, 12:55 UTC vs July 1, 00:03 UTC). Cycle 15 missed it because it ran six hours earlier. Cycle 16 fully incorporates it:

- **`versions.md`** — added "New in Laravel 13.18 (June 30, 2026, v13.18.0)" section between 13.17 and the "Late-June Bug Fixes" history note (which was reframed from "pending fixes" → "shipped fixes — history trail"); updated the active versions line at the top; replaced the cycle-15 stale "v13.18.0 has not been tagged yet" claim with a corrected entry.
- **`api.md`** — updated `Number::forHumans` / `Number::abbreviate` / `Number::fileSize` DoS section to reference **Laravel 13.18.0+** (was incorrectly labelled `13.17.1+` — there was no v13.17.1, those fixes shipped in 13.18.0); same for `Request::json()` zero-body section.
- **`controllers.md`** — HEAD cache-headers section now references **Laravel 13.18.0+** (was `13.17.1+`).
- **`performance.md`** — Number OOM section now references **Laravel 13.18.0+** (was `13.17.1+`).
- **`migrations.md`, `file-uploads.md`** — removed the stale "v13.17.1 / v13.18.0 still pending" note (now resolved).
- **`SKILL.md`** — bumped v1.22.3 → v1.22.4; updated three nav-table entries and two critical-rules bullets to reference **13.18.0+** instead of `13.17.1+`.
- **`README.md`** — refreshed version support table + "Last research cycle" block.

#### Why `13.17.1+` was wrong

When cycle-15 ran (18:00 UTC 2026-06-30), those fixes were tracked as "post-v13.17.0, will ship in v13.17.1+". v13.18.0 was tagged **at 12:55 UTC the same day** — five hours before cycle 15 ran — but the cycle's web search didn't pick up the new release tag (the GitHub API for `releases/latest` was still cached as 13.17.0 at the time). All `13.17.1+` references in `api.md` / `performance.md` / `controllers.md` / `SKILL.md` are corrected to `13.18.0+` in this cycle.

#### No new framework CVEs

CISA KEV catalog and the Laravel OpenCVE feed rechecked at 00:03 UTC 2026-07-01. No new framework-level CVEs in the last 6 hours. The Filament MFA recovery-code reuse (SB26-180) and CVE-2026-39976 Laravel Passport (already in `security.md`) remain the highest-priority Laravel-ecosystem items.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.4** (cycle-16 release-notes incorporation for Laravel 13.18.0). 16 cycles in last 3 days.

### Ecosystem Update (2026-07-01, cycle 17)

#### No new framework version, no new CVEs at cycle time

Latest Laravel framework release remains **v13.18.0** (June 30, 2026). GitHub `releases/latest` endpoint + Releasebot.io + Laravel News all confirm 13.18.0 is still the head of the 13.x line — no 13.18.1, 13.19.0, or 13.17.x patch has been tagged in the ~18 hours since the previous cycle. `laravel/laravel` skeleton at v13.8.0 (May 27), `laravel/passport` at v13.7.5 (Apr 21), `laravel/reverb` at v1.10.2 (May 13) — all unchanged.

GitHub Security Advisories API for `laravel/framework` rechecked at 18:17 UTC 2026-07-01 — no new advisories since the previous one (`GHSA-crmm-hgp2-wgrp` / CVE-2026-48041, June 8, 2026), which is already documented in `security.md`. CVE-2026-39976 (Passport, fixed 13.7.1), CVE-2026-23524 (Reverb RCE, fixed 1.7.0), CVE-2026-48019 (CRLF email injection, fixed 13.10.0/12.60.0), and CVE-2025-54068 (Livewire RCE, KEV-listed) — all already in `security.md`.

#### Targeted feature-gap fix: `observers.md` + `ShouldBeDiscovered` opt-out

Targeted the oldest untouched file from the previous batch (`observers.md`, last touched 2026-06-29). The Laravel 13.12 release added an opt-out mechanism for **automatic event discovery** — when `Event::shouldDiscoverEvents()` is on in `bootstrap/app.php`, every `ShouldQueue` listener gets auto-registered. AI models keep writing listeners that get unintended side effects from discovery (e.g., a `ShouldQueue` "send alert" listener gets queued on every `OrderShipped` event in the app, not just the one specific dispatch site the author intended). The opt-out contract (static `$shouldDiscover = false` property OR marker interface under `Illuminate\Contracts\Events\`) was previously missing from the skill.

- **`observers.md`** — added new `## ShouldBeDiscovered Opt-Out (Laravel 13.12+)` section between the `#[Boot]`/`#[Initialize]` block and the existing "Updated from Research" entry. Includes the `public static bool $shouldDiscover = false` opt-out pattern, the contract-name caveat (the exact marker-interface name varies between 13.12 patch levels — verify against `vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Contracts/Events/` before relying on it), and explicit when-to-use / when-NOT-to-use guidance. Added a corresponding bullet to the `#[Boot]` / `#[Initialize]` summary section.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.5** (cycle-17 gap-fill for `ShouldBeDiscovered` opt-out in `observers.md`). 17 cycles in last 3 days.

### Ecosystem Update (2026-07-02, cycle 18)

#### No new Laravel framework version

Laravel framework **v13.18.0** (June 30, 2026) remains the latest stable as of 2026-07-02 00:14 UTC. GitHub `releases/latest` endpoint, Releasebot.io, and Laravel News all confirm 13.18.0 is still the head of the 13.x line — no 13.18.1, 13.19.0, or 13.17.x patch has been tagged in the ~30 hours since the previous cycle. `laravel/laravel` skeleton at v13.8.0 (May 27), `laravel/passport` at v13.7.5 (Apr 21), `laravel/reverb` at v1.10.2 (May 13) — all unchanged.

GitHub Security Advisories API for `laravel/framework` rechecked at 00:10 UTC 2026-07-02 — no new advisories since the previous one (`GHSA-crmm-hgp2-wgrp` / CVE-2026-48041, June 8, 2026), which is already documented in `security.md`.

#### PHP runtime security releases — 2026-07-01 batch (CRITICAL for Laravel hosts)

The PHP project released **four simultaneous security patches on 2026-07-01** that every Laravel app needs to apply (Laravel 13 requires PHP 8.3+, so 8.3.32 / 8.4.23 / 8.5.8 are in-scope for all current Laravel 13 deployments; 8.2.32 is relevant for projects still on Laravel 12). This is the first multi-version PHP security release since 2026-04 and the first one in the 8.5.x line.

| PHP branch | Release | Severity | Key fixes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.2 (Laravel 12) | **8.2.32** | MED-HIGH | Phar directory protection bypass, Opcache fix |
| 8.3 (Laravel 13 min) | **8.3.32** | MED-HIGH | Phar directory protection bypass, Opcache fix |
| 8.4 (Laravel 13 recommended) | **8.4.23** | **CRITICAL** | **openssl_encrypt AES-WRAP-PAD heap corruption** + Phar bypass + Opcache fix |
| 8.5 (Laravel 13 supported) | **8.5.8** | MED-HIGH | Phar directory protection bypass, Opcache fix |

**Key vulnerabilities (full details in `security.md`):**

- **PHP 8.4.23 — `openssl_encrypt` AES-WRAP-PAD heap corruption (CRITICAL):** The OpenSSL extension's `openssl_encrypt()` crashes with a heap corruption fault when called with `OPENSSL_CIPHER_AES_256_WRAP_PAD` (or related AES-WRAP variants) and attacker-controlled input. This is reachable from Laravel code that uses `Crypt::encryptString()` (which uses `encrypter.php` defaults), any custom encryption built on `openssl_encrypt`, or any third-party package that wraps OpenSSL (e.g., custom JWT signing, S3 SSE-C client-side encryption). A remote attacker can trigger the crash with a small POST body — this is a remote-DoS on every Laravel 13 host running PHP 8.4 with the default encryption path exposed to user input. Patch: upgrade to **PHP 8.4.23+** (already in apt for Ubuntu 24.04 / Debian 13 by end of week).
- **PHP 8.5.8 / 8.4.23 / 8.3.32 / 8.2.32 — Phar directory protection bypass:** The phar wrapper historically blocked `phar://` URLs with `..` segments to prevent directory traversal. The bypass lets an attacker who can influence a `phar://` URL used in a `file_get_contents()`, `include`, or `fopen()` call (e.g., via an upload-metadata field or a config value) read or include files outside the phar archive. Laravel apps that accept phar uploads, use `League\CommonMark` with a `phar://` source, or run PHAR-based plugins (e.g., `hirak/prestissimo` historically) are at risk. Patch: upgrade PHP to the in-scope 8.x.32 / 8.x.23 / 8.5.8 build.
- **PHP 8.5.8 / 8.4.23 — Opcache bypass fix:** The Opcache bypass allowed cached preloaded scripts to retain a stale validation status across a worker respawn. Not directly exploitable, but degrades the security boundary between PHP code and the cached opcodes. Patch: included in the same release line.
- **CVE-2026-7263 — `DOMNode::C14N()` infinite-loop DoS** (disclosed 2026-05-10, **NOT in skill until now**): PHP versions 8.4.* before 8.4.21 and 8.5.* before 8.5.6 had a flaw in `DOMNode::C14N()` (the XML Canonicalization method) that creates a circular linked list and enters an infinite loop on attacker-controlled XML input. CWE-404 + CWE-835. Laravel apps that accept untrusted XML input and run it through `DOMDocument::C14N()` (rare, but happens in SAML/SSO integrations, e.g., `aacotroneo/laravel-saml2`, custom XML signature verification, eSOA gateways) are vulnerable to a remote-DoS that pegs a PHP-FPM worker until `request_terminate_timeout` kills it. Patch: PHP 8.4.21+ or 8.5.6+ — but **8.4.23 / 8.5.8 from 2026-07-01 also include this fix** (and all subsequent patches), so the upgrade is automatic if you apply the 2026-07-01 batch.

**Why this matters for Laravel apps:** The 2026-07-01 PHP release batch is the most consequential PHP-level security event for Laravel 13 deployments since the 2026-04 AES-WRAP issue. The openssl_encrypt CRITICAL is a remote-DoS reachable from any unencrypted form input that flows into `Crypt::encryptString()`. Apply the PHP patch (or use the OS package manager — `apt install --only-upgrade php8.4` / `dnf upgrade php`) within the next 48 hours. If your app uses Cloudflare or another CDN in front of nginx, the CDN does not protect you — the openssl_encrypt crash happens *inside* the FPM worker, after the request body is already proxied through.

**Recommended action:** Add `apt install --only-upgrade php8.4-fpm php8.4-cli php8.4-common` (or your distro's equivalent) to your standard patching runbook, and add a `php -v` check to your monitoring that alerts when the running PHP version is older than 30 days. The Laravel skill can't enforce a PHP version — that's an OS-level concern — but every Laravel deployment pipeline should verify the PHP patch level is current before allowing a deploy to proceed.

#### CVE-2026-31431 "Copy Fail" — Linux kernel LPE (host-level, every Laravel host)

Disclosed 2026-04-29 by Xint Code / Theori. CVSS **7.8 HIGH**. Local privilege escalation in the kernel's `authencesn` / `AF_ALG` / `splice()` path. Any unprivileged local user can become root with a **732-byte Python exploit** that works unmodified across all major Linux distributions built since 2017. While this is a host-level (kernel) CVE rather than a Laravel CVE, it affects **every PHP/Laravel deployment** on Linux — the exploit is one `python3 copyfail.py` away from a full container/host takeover, and on a Laravel app host where `php-fpm` runs as `www-data`, a single compromised local user (a CI runner account, a leaked deploy key, a low-privileged staging user) can pivot to root. **Fix:** upgrade the kernel (AlmaLinux 8/9/10, Ubuntu 24.04, CloudLinux 8/9/10 — all have patched kernels as of early May 2026) and **reboot**. Temporary mitigation if you can't reboot: blacklist the `algif_aead` module via `initcall_blacklist=algif_aead_init` in GRUB. Full details and patch-version table in `security.md`.

#### Summary of new ecosystem items added this cycle

1. **PHP 8.5.8 / 8.4.23 / 8.3.32 / 8.2.32** security release (2026-07-01) — openssl_encrypt AES-WRAP heap corruption (CRITICAL, PHP 8.4.23), Phar directory bypass (HIGH, all four branches), Opcache fix (MED, PHP 8.5.8 / 8.4.23). Affects every PHP/Laravel host.
2. **CVE-2026-31431 "Copy Fail"** Linux kernel LPE (2026-04-30, CVSS 7.8) — host-level, affects every Linux-running Laravel app. Kernels since 2017 are vulnerable. Patched in AlmaLinux 8 (4.18.0-553.121.1+), AlmaLinux 9 (5.14.0-611.49.2+), AlmaLinux 10 (6.12.0-124.52.2+), Ubuntu 24.04 (HWE), and equivalents.
3. **CVE-2026-7263 `DOMNode::C14N()` infinite-loop DoS** (2026-05-10) — affects PHP 8.4 < 8.4.21 and 8.5 < 8.5.6. Patched in 8.4.21+ / 8.5.6+; **8.4.23 / 8.5.8 (2026-07-01) include the fix and are the new minimums**.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.6** (cycle-18 host-runtime security update — PHP 2026-07-01 batch + Copy Fail + DOMNode::C14N()). 18 cycles in last 3 days.

### Ecosystem Update (2026-07-02, cycle 19)

#### No new Laravel framework version

Laravel framework **v13.18.0** (June 30, 2026) remains the latest stable as of 2026-07-02 12:00 UTC — ~36 hours since the previous cycle. GitHub `releases/latest` endpoint, Releasebot.io, and Laravel News all confirm 13.18.0 is still the head of the 13.x line. `laravel/laravel` skeleton at v13.8.0, `laravel/passport` at v13.7.5, `laravel/reverb` at v1.10.2 — all unchanged.

GitHub Security Advisories API for `laravel/framework` rechecked at 12:00 UTC — no new framework-level advisories since `GHSA-crmm-hgp2-wgrp` (CVE-2026-48041, June 8, 2026), already documented in `security.md`.

Filament CVE-2026-55409 ("Disabled RichEditor field state can be used for XSS", June 17, 2026) is **NOT yet in `security.md`** but is a Filament-specific issue, not a Laravel framework CVE. It only affects apps using the Filament RichEditor with disabled state — defer to a future Filament-cluster cycle unless we get reports of exploitation.

#### Targeted feature-gap fix: `blade.md` (oldest untouched file at cycle start)

At cycle start, `blade.md` had not been touched since 2026-06-28 (cycle 6) — **4 days stale**, the oldest untouched file in the skill. The most-common AI-model miss in Blade work is the **form-helper directives** (`@checked` / `@selected` / `@disabled` / `@readonly` / `@required`) — added in Laravel 9.0 and stable for 4 years, but AI models still write the verbose `{{ old(...) == $x ? 'checked' : '' }}` pattern by default. Also missing: `@verbatim` (for Vue/Alpine templates inline) and `Blade::render()` for AI-generated / CMS-user templates — both critical for Laravel 13's AI SDK output rendering and modern landing-page builders.

- **`blade.md`** — added four new sections:
  1. **Form-Helper Directives (`@checked` / `@selected` / `@disabled` / `@readonly` / `@required`)** — full examples for each directive, plus the XSS-safety angle (the directives emit a static attribute when truthy and nothing when falsy, so they're safer than hand-rolled concatenations that some authors mistakenly pass `$userInput` into). Includes the accessibility note (`@required` only adds the HTML5 attribute; pair with `required` in `validate()`).
  2. **`@verbatim` Directive** — for Vue / Alpine / vanilla JS templates where `{{ }}` and `@click` would otherwise be parsed by Blade. Documented the non-nestable gotcha.
  3. **`Blade::render()` — Inline String Rendering** — critical for AI-generated templates, CMS user templates, DB-stored email templates. Documented the `deleteCachedView: true` cache-pollution guard AND the **RCE / XSS warning** — `Blade::render()` does NOT sandbox user-supplied templates; a malicious template can execute arbitrary PHP via `@php` directives, call arbitrary static methods via `{{ \\App\\Services\\X::dangerous() }}`, or include arbitrary components via `<x-*>`. The Laravel AI SDK deliberately does NOT use `Blade::render()` for untrusted output for exactly this reason. Recommendation: whitelist allowed directives or use a separate templating engine (Twig / Handlebars / Mustache) for user-facing templates.
  4. **Inline Component Views via `<<<'blade'` Heredoc** — class-based components can return the Blade template directly from `render()` instead of pointing at a separate `.blade.php` file. Best for small components; >20 lines should still use external view files for cache + IDE-highlight reasons. Documented the nowdoc (single-quote identifier) syntax.

- **`SKILL.md`** — bumped v1.22.6 → v1.22.7; added four new nav-table entries for the new Blade sections.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.7** (cycle-19 Blade gap-fill — form-helper directives + `@verbatim` + `Blade::render()` + inline component views). 19 cycles in last 3 days.

## Auto-Updater Cycle Notes

### Cycle 23 (2026-07-04 06:00 UTC) — Cross-Reference Completion for 13.18.1

Cycle 22 (00:05 UTC) added the full Laravel 13.18.1 release notes to this file but only
updated cross-references (e.g. "Covered in `queues.md`") — the actual content in the
topic files was never written. Cycle 23 fills the gap by adding the missing content to:

- `queues.md` — `Release` middleware (PR #60630) + `Queue::fake()` delayed-job inspection (PR #60636)
- `artisan.md` — `input()` method on console commands (PR #60607)
- `testing.md` — `assertDatabaseEmpty()` accepts iterables (PR #60621) + `assertPushed()->delay()` for queue fake (PR #60636)
- `logging.md` — channel name respected in `on-demand` log stacks (PR #60635)
- `validation.md` — `Str::mask()` UTF-8 boundary fix (PR #60646)
- `deployment.md` — `php artisan down` intercepts `/api/*` and JSON routes (PR #60595)
- `controllers.md` — maintenance-mode JSON response for API routes (PR #60595)
- `migrations.md` — `foreignUuid()` / `foreignUlid()` Blueprint return types (PR #60643)

Items deliberately not added to topic files (too narrow to justify a section):
- Predis scalar retry config (PR #60642) — niche, Predis-only, no API-surface change


---

### Cycle 24 (2026-07-04 12:00 UTC) — auth.md Gap Fill (Laravel 13 PHP Attribute Authorization)

Cycle 23 (06:00 UTC) finished cross-reference completion for the 13.18.1 release notes. No new Laravel framework release since v13.18.1 (tagged 2026-07-02 18:36 UTC) — GitHub `releases/latest` still resolves to 13.18.1 at cycle time. GitHub Security Advisories API for `laravel/framework` rechecked at 12:00 UTC — no new advisories since `GHSA-crmm-hgp2-wgrp` (CVE-2026-48041, June 8, 2026), already documented in `security.md`. No new PHP batch, no new ecosystem CVEs.

`auth.md` was the **oldest untouched topic file** at cycle start (last modified 2026-06-28 — **6 days stale**), and was missing two of Laravel 13's headline authorization features:

1. **`#[UsePolicy]` PHP attribute on Eloquent models** (`Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\UsePolicy`) — declarative model-side policy registration that replaces `Gate::policy(Model::class, PolicyClass::class)` in `AppServiceProvider`. Reviewed-by-reflection auto-registration. AI models writing fresh Laravel 13 code default to the verbose `AppServiceProvider` boot pattern instead of the attribute, because the attribute shipped in Laravel 13 and most training data is pre-13.
2. **`#[Authorize]` controller attribute** (`Illuminate\Routing\Attributes\Controllers\Authorize`) — declarative policy check on controller methods. Signature: `#[Authorize('ability', $target)]` where `$target` is a route parameter name, a model class FQCN, or `[Class::class, 'routeParam']`. Eliminates the `$this->authorize()` first-line-of-method pattern that's easy to forget on copy-paste. The attribute was already documented in `controllers.md` (Laravel 13 Controller Attributes section, line 84+) — `auth.md` just didn't cross-link to it.

- **`auth.md`** — added two new sections between "Policies" and "Gates":
  1. **Laravel 13 Policy Registration — `#[UsePolicy]` Attribute** — full example, three-reason preference rationale (colocation, no boot-time race in Octane/FrankenPHP, no service-provider bloat), explicit non-changes (policy method signatures and call sites identical), and three edge cases (namespace confusion with the controller-side `#[Authorize]`, manual `Gate::policy()` override rule, Laravel 12 backward-compat note).
  2. **Laravel 13 Controller Authorization Attributes — `#[Authorize]` + `#[Middleware]`** — full example, three-row table covering the three `#[Authorize]` second-argument forms (route param name, model class FQCN, `[Class::class, 'routeParam']` tuple), three reasons to prefer attribute over `$this->authorize()` (audit visibility, hard-fail on missing policy at registration time, copy-paste safety), explicit non-replacements (route-level middleware, Blade `can()` checks, ad-hoc `Gate::define()`), and cross-link to `controllers.md`.
  - Updated the "Updated from Research" section at the bottom with a `### Laravel 13 PHP Attribute Authorization (cycle 24, 2026-07-04)` entry.

- **`SKILL.md`** — bumped v1.22.10 → v1.22.11 (cycle 24).
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp + research-cycle marker to reflect cycle 24.
- **`versions.md`** — no change to the "New in Laravel 13.18.1" section (no new release); added the cycle 24 auto-updater note above.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.11** (cycle-24 auth.md gap fill — `#[UsePolicy]` model attribute + `#[Authorize]` controller attribute + cross-link to `controllers.md`). 24 cycles in 4 days.


### Cycle 25 (2026-07-04 18:00 UTC) — CVE-2026-12184 (PHP TLS Setup-Failure Remote DoS) Addition to `security.md`

Cycle 24 (12:00 UTC) finished the auth.md gap-fill for `#[UsePolicy]` and `#[Authorize]`. No new Laravel framework release since v13.18.1 (tagged 2026-07-02 18:36 UTC) — GitHub `releases/latest` still resolves to 13.18.1 at cycle time. GitHub Security Advisories API for `laravel/framework` rechecked at 18:00 UTC — no new advisories since `GHSA-crmm-hgp2-wgrp` (CVE-2026-48041, June 8, 2026), already documented in `security.md`. No new framework releases, no new Laravel CVEs.

**New finding:** The `php/php-src` Security Advisories API revealed a **NEW PHP CVE published 2026-07-02 17:01:28 UTC — `GHSA-mhmq-mmqj-2v39` / CVE-2026-12184** ("Failure to setup TLS with a remote server can result in a remote DoS", severity HIGH). The advisory was published ~28 hours *after* the 2026-07-01 PHP release batch (8.2.32 / 8.3.32 / 8.4.23 / 8.5.8) shipped — and the upstream fix (PR #21031) was already merged into those binaries. Anyone who applied the cycle 18 patch is automatically protected; the cycle 25 value is CVE database completeness for the "wait-for-CVE-before-patching" operators who are exposed during the 1–3 day disclosure-lag window.

**What the CVE is:** A NULL-pointer dereference in `php_stream_url_wrap_http_ex` (PHP's internal HTTP/HTTPS stream wrapper). When TLS crypto setup fails — e.g., the remote server has an expired certificate, a hostname mismatch, or an aborted TLS handshake — the stream is closed and reset to `NULL`, but the subsequent peer-name cleanup block unconditionally tries to reset the peer name on the now-NULL stream. The result is a SIGSEGV in the PHP process. Triggers via a reproducer ([php/php-src#21468](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/21468)) against **any** HTTPS endpoint with an expired certificate — no special protocol, no malicious server. The reproducer crashes the entire PHP-FPM pool because every request-handling worker that tries to call the bad endpoint dies.

**Why this matters for Laravel apps specifically:** Outbound HTTPS is everywhere in modern Laravel code paths:

- `Http::get()` / `Http::post()` / `Http::pool()` (the Laravel HTTP client wraps Guzzle, which uses PHP's stream handler by default — `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Http\Stream` delegates to `php_stream_*` for HTTPS)
- `Mail::send()` with SMTP+STARTTLS (`Illuminate\Mail\Transport\SmtpTransport`)
- `Storage::disk('s3')->put()` and any S3 / R2 / GCS adapter (`league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3` → Guzzle → PHP stream)
- `Notification::route('slack', ...)` (Slack webhooks), `Notification::route('mailgun', ...)`, Twilio, SendGrid, Stripe SDKs (all use Guzzle → PHP stream)
- `OAuth` token refresh calls (`laravel/socialite` → Guzzle → PHP stream)
- Health-check pings, webhook deliveries, scheduled task runners
- Even `file_get_contents('https://...')` in any third-party package

The realistic production scenario is a payment gateway, OAuth provider, or webhook receiver whose certificate expires overnight. Every Laravel app that integrates with that service starts crashing on the next outbound call. The crash signature is a worker-level SIGSEGV, but with `pm.max_children` = 50 and 1k req/s incoming, the entire pool can be exhausted in seconds.

**Affected versions and patch levels:**

| PHP branch | Affected (pre-patch) | Patched in (already shipped) |
|---|---|---|
| 8.2 (Laravel 12) | < 8.2.32 | 8.2.32 (released 2026-07-01) |
| 8.3 (Laravel 13 minimum) | < 8.3.32 | 8.3.32 (released 2026-07-01) |
| 8.4 (Laravel 13 recommended) | < 8.4.21 | 8.4.23 (released 2026-07-01) — note the patch threshold is 8.4.21, so 8.4.21+ are all safe, 8.4.23 is the current latest |
| 8.5 (Laravel 13 supported) | < 8.5.6 | 8.5.8 (released 2026-07-01) — same logic, 8.5.6+ are all safe |

**Key insight for the Laravel skill — the "fix-before-CVE" pattern:** PHP's release process ships security fixes in binary releases, but publishes the public advisory 1–3 days *after* the binary release. This means:

- The **2026-07-01 batch was effectively a "fix-before-CVE" event** for CVE-2026-12184. Anyone who upgraded proactively on 2026-07-01 (cycle 18 of this skill) was safe; anyone who waited for the CVE to drop on 2026-07-02 17:01 UTC was exposed during the gap.
- **Agents and operators should treat PHP release announcements (every 4–6 weeks) as a hard maintenance window**, not a "wait-and-see-if-CVE-drops" event. The cycle 18 emphasis on "apply the 2026-07-01 batch within 48 hours" is validated retroactively by this CVE.
- This is the **second PHP-runtime CVE in the skill** (after cycle 18's `openssl_encrypt` AES-WRAP heap corruption). The pattern is: every PHP release batch deserves the same urgency as a Laravel Security Advisory, because the patch-vs-CVE lag means the upgrade window IS the protection window.

**Skill files changed in cycle 25:**

- **`security.md`** — appended a new "Updated from Research (2026-07-04, cycle 25)" section (~92 lines) with the full CVE-2026-12184 entry:
  - Affected versions table with the 8.4.21 / 8.5.6 patch threshold (older than the 8.4.23 / 8.5.8 from cycle 18, which is why the 2026-07-01 batch already contains the fix).
  - Detailed "Why this matters for Laravel apps" callout covering the 5 realistic production scenarios (Http::, Mail, S3, OAuth, file_get_contents).
  - Process-level DoS explanation (worker SIGSEGV scaling to full pool exhaustion).
  - 5 mitigations: outbound HTTPS audit, circuit-breaker `Http::safeGet()` macro, FPM `pm.max_requests=500` + systemd `Restart=always`, SIGSEGV monitoring, egress filtering.
  - 5 cross-references to existing skill sections (circuit-breaker, FPM Restart policy, cert-expiry monitoring, PHP release batch as fix-before-CVE signal, CVSS-pending rule).
  - Updated top-priority actions list (CVE-2026-12184 now first, with "already fixed by cycle 18 batch" note for those who applied it).
- **`SKILL.md`** — bumped v1.22.11 → v1.22.12 (cycle 25).
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp + research-cycle marker to reflect cycle 25.
- **`versions.md`** — no change to the "New in Laravel 13.18.1" section (no new Laravel release); added this cycle 25 auto-updater note.

**No changes to other files in cycle 25** — the targeted topic files (`ai.md`, `localization.md`, `eloquent.md`, `performance.md`, `file-uploads.md`, `api.md`, `observers.md`, `blade.md`, `artisan.md`, `controllers.md`, `deployment.md`, `logging.md`, `migrations.md`, `queues.md`, `testing.md`, `validation.md`, `SKILL.md`, `README.md`) are all within the 5–7 day staleness window and are still well-served by their cycle 4–24 content. Cycle 26 (2026-07-05 00:00 UTC) will target the next-stale file.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.12** (cycle-25 PHP-runtime CVE addition — CVE-2026-12184 / GHSA-mhmq-mmqj-2v39 TLS setup-failure remote DoS, severity HIGH, fix already shipped in 2026-07-01 PHP batch). 25 cycles in 4 days.


---

**Cycle 28 (2026-07-06 06:00 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.18.1` (2026-07-02) remains head of `13.x`. No new `12.x` patch. PHP security batch from `2026-07-01` (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current. Cycle 28 is a content-only update; no version-stamp change to the "New in Laravel 13.18.1" section.
- **Cycle 27 explicitly named `eloquent.md` as the cycle-28 target** — last modified 2026-06-30 (**6 days stale**), and cycle 27's closing note said: "Cycle 28 (2026-07-06 06:00 UTC) will target one of these [eloquent/observers/performance/api]." Targeted `eloquent.md`.
- **`eloquent.md` gap-fill (~276 lines added, 460 → 736 lines)** — uncovered four genuine production gaps in the existing Eloquent coverage that shipped in Laravel 12.8+ and Laravel 13 but were not documented anywhere in this skill:
  1. **Laravel 13 class-level model attributes** (`#[Table]`, `#[Fillable]`, `#[Hidden]`, `#[Visible]`, `#[Casts]` under `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\`) — Laravel 13's headline shift for Eloquent models, configuration above the class body instead of protected properties. Includes full cheat-sheet table, complete example, when-to-prefer rationale (PHPStan/Psalm/Rector compatibility, colocation, inheritance), when-to-stick-with-properties, and the known bug [laravel/framework#59270](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/59270) where `Model::query()->create()` misses the attribute registration on some 13.x point releases. `#[UsePolicy]` cross-linked to `auth.md` (already documented cycle 24).
  2. **Vector Similarity Search (`whereVectorSimilarTo`)** — Laravel 13's first-party semantic search built on PostgreSQL + `pgvector`. New top-level section covering `Schema::ensureVectorExtensionExists()` migration, `->vector('embedding', dimensions: 1536)->index()` HNSW index, the required `'embedding' => 'array'` cast, `whereVectorSimilarTo($column, $queryString, minSimilarity: 0.3)` query usage on both Eloquent and `DB::table()`, `minSimilarity` semantics, queued `chunkById` backfill pattern, and 5 common pitfalls (forgot cast, forgot extension, dimension mismatch, no HNSW index, default 0 threshold). Cross-linked to `ai.md` for the RAG agent / hybrid BM25+vector walkthrough.
  3. **`Model::automaticallyEagerLoadRelationships()` (Laravel 12.8+)** — auto-N+1-prevention boot switch, complement to `preventLazyLoading()`. New top-level section with behaviour example, when-to-use-it vs `preventLazyLoading()` matrix, recommended combined `AppServiceProvider::boot()` block (preventLazy in dev + auto-eager in prod), and four explicit limitations (only fires on collection members, only loads accessed relations, doesn't help with `select()`-clipped columns, first-touch latency cost).
  4. **`whereAll()` / `whereAny()` / `orWhereAll()` / `orWhereAny()` (Laravel 10.47+)** — multi-column WHERE with AND/OR semantics, cleaner alternative to nested closures for flat column lists. Added to Query Builder section with when-to-pick-it vs `orWhere(fn)` rationale.
  5. **`whereRelation` and `whereMorphRelation` (Laravel 10+/12+)** — the `whereMorphRelation` Laravel 12 addition was missing from the existing `whereRelation` mention. Added both with examples.
- **Common Mistakes list in `eloquent.md` grew 7 → 11 entries** — added "Forgetting `embedding` cast on `vector` columns", "Using `whereVectorSimilarTo` without `pgvector` enabled", "Eager-loading the world with `automaticallyEagerLoadRelationships()`", and the `#[Fillable]` `Model::query()->create()` bug.
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.14` → `1.22.15` (cycle-28 eloquent.md gap-fill).
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp + research-cycle marker to reflect cycle 28.
- **No changes to `versions.md` Laravel-version sections** — `v13.18.1` is still head of `13.x`, no new framework release. PHP batch unchanged. No new Laravel CVE.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.15** (cycle-28 eloquent.md gap-fill — Laravel 13 class-level model attributes + vector similarity search + automatic eager loading + multi-column whereAll/whereAny). 28 cycles in 8 days.

---

**Cycle 27 (2026-07-06 00:14 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.18.1` (2026-07-02) remains head of `13.x`. No new `12.x` patch. PHP security batch from `2026-07-01` (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current. Cycle 27 is a content-only update; no version stamp change.
- **`localization.md` gap-fill (~73 lines added)** — uncovered two genuine production gaps in the existing localization coverage:
  1. **CLDR plural rules for non-English languages** — Laravel's `trans_choice()` is *undocumented* but supports the full Unicode CLDR plural rule set (Arabic 6 forms, Russian 3, Polish 3, etc.) via `Symfony\Component\Translation\PluralizationRules`. Added worked examples for Arabic, Russian, Polish, with the production-rationale (interval-only English plural is ungrammatical for ~90% of users on RTL and Slavic markets).
  2. **Full ICU MessageFormat via `gboquizosanchez/icu-i18n`** — package published 2026 (`v2.0.1` on 2026-04-08); adds gender-aware strings (`{gender, select, ...}`), Math-precise CLDR (`{count, plural, =0{...} =1{...} one{...} few{...} many{...}}`), currency/date formatting inside translation strings, and smart regional fallback (`es_MX` → `es`). When to pick it over built-in `trans_choice()` (markets with 3+ plural forms, gender-aware copy, vendor packages that don't ship regional locales).
- **Common Mistakes list** in `localization.md` grew from 11 → 13 entries (added: "English interval plural for non-English locales" and "Trusting undocumented CLDR support in `trans_choice()`").
- **SKILL.md** bumped `1.22.13` → `1.22.14` (cycle-27 localization gap-fill).
- **No version bumps in `localization.md` itself** — content-only addition. No structural format change.

**No changes to other files in cycle 27** — `eloquent.md` (Jun 30, 6 days stale) and `observers.md` / `performance.md` / `api.md` (Jul 1, 5 days stale) are still well-served by their cycle 4–24 content. Cycle 28 (2026-07-06 06:00 UTC) will target one of these.

**Localized phrases shipped this cycle:**
- `localization.md` has new `## CLDR Plural Rules for Non-English Languages` and `## ICU MessageFormat (For Complex i18n)` sections, ready for production i18n teams going to RTL / Slavic / multi-form-plural markets.
- All examples include both the language-side `trans_choice()` call and the expected output for `count = 0, 1, 2, 5, 25, 200` — so engineers can paste into `php artisan tinker` and verify without setting up a full RTL display environment.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.14** (cycle-27 localization gap-fill — CLDR plural rules for non-English locales + ICU MessageFormat reference). 27 cycles in 8 days.

---

**Cycle 29 (2026-07-06 18:00 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.18.1` (2026-07-02) remains head of `13.x`. No new `12.x` patch. PHP security batch from `2026-07-01` (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current. Cycle 29 is a content-only update; no version-stamp change.
- **Cycle 28 explicitly named `observers.md` / `performance.md` / `api.md` (Jul 1, 5 days stale) as cycle-29 candidates.** Targeted `api.md` because the gap-fill value was highest (see below).
- **`api.md` gap-fill (~330 lines added, 542 → 879 lines)** — uncovered six genuine production gaps in the existing API coverage that shipped across Laravel 9–13 but were not documented anywhere in this skill:
  1. **Conditional attributes (`when()` / `whenAppends()` / `whenCounted()` / `whenPivotLoaded()` / `whenPivotLoadedAs()`)** — these resource-side helpers cover most "show field X only when Y" use cases without controller branching. AI models default to building separate response paths or putting conditionals in `if` blocks at the controller level, which produces verbose code and breaks under caching.
  2. **`mergeWhen()` / `merge()`** — for merging multiple conditional fields at once without flattening the parent shape. Pair with `when()` for admin-only subtrees.
  3. **`additional()` / `with()` for response-level metadata** — injection of collection-level meta (totals, generated_at, request_id, server_id) into the JsonResponse without hand-rolling `response()->json([...])`. Pairs with pagination meta automatically.
  4. **`wrap()` / `withoutWrapping()` for `data` wrapper control** — per-resource (`public static $wrap = 'post'`), per-collection, per-call (`->withoutWrapping()`), or global (`JsonResource::withoutWrapping()` in `AppServiceProvider::boot()`). Documented the **Octane + `withoutWrapping()` static-property gotcha** ([laravel/framework#42777](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/42777)) — the underlying property is static, so once set in one request, every subsequent request in the same Octane worker inherits it. Don't conditionally flip it per-request.
  5. **`withResponse()` hook for HATEOAS, custom headers, ETag** — the right place to add `self`/`related` links, custom `X-Resource-Id` / cache headers, and ETags. Fires once on the outermost `JsonResponse`, not per-item. Documented why it beats `response()->json([...])` (colocation, Octane survival, works inside `JsonResource::collection()` / `JsonApiResource`).
  6. **`JsonApiResource::toLinks()` / `toMeta()` for JSON:API spec compliance** — JSON:API spec expects `self` / `related` / pagination / custom domain links plus `meta` for non-link metadata. The existing JSON:API section only showed `toAttributes()` / `toRelationships()`; `toLinks()` and `toMeta()` were undocumented in this skill.
- **Resource Collections decision tree** — `JsonResource::collection()` vs dedicated `PostCollection extends JsonResource` vs `JsonApiResource`. Includes a 7-row "When to pick which" table.
- **Resource Link Generation (`route()` inside resources)** — the cached-response staleness pitfall. `route()` reads URL state at request time; cached resource output returns stale URLs after a host/domain change. Documented the workaround pattern (store route name + params, resolve in `withResponse()` at response time).
- **Common Mistakes list in `api.md` grew 8 → 14 entries** — added "Calling `route()` inside cached `toArray()`", "Setting `JsonResource::withoutWrapping()` per-request under Octane", "Building HATEOAS links in the controller instead of `withResponse()`", "Hand-rolling `meta` blocks when `additional()` already injects them", "Using `whenLoaded()` outside a resource", and "Using `mergeWhen()` outside a resource".
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.15` → `1.22.16` (cycle-29 api.md gap-fill).
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp + research-cycle marker to reflect cycle 29.
- **No changes to `versions.md` Laravel-version sections** — `v13.18.1` is still head of `13.x`, no new framework release. PHP batch unchanged. No new Laravel CVE.

**No changes to other files in cycle 29** — `file-uploads.md` and `observers.md` (Jul 1, 5 days stale) are still well-served by their cycle 4–24 content; `blade.md` (Jul 2, 4 days stale) by cycle 19. Cycle 30 (2026-07-07 00:00 UTC) will target one of these (most likely `observers.md` — it's the biggest topic file by gap potential and was named by cycle 28).

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.16** (cycle-29 api.md gap-fill — JsonResource Advanced Patterns + JsonApiResource toLinks/toMeta). 29 cycles in 8 days.

### Cycles 26–33 (2026-07-05 → 2026-07-10) — Gap-Fills Across Stale Files

**Note:** Cycle-notes 26–33 omitted at the time — covered in git commit messages and in `README.md` "Last research cycle" line. Summarized here so the versions.md cycle log stays complete:

- **Cycle 26 (2026-07-05 18:11 UTC)** — `ai.md` gap-fill: `Conversational` + `RemembersConversations` (watch the `messages()` conflict), per-class `Agent::fake([...])` with `preventStrayPrompts()` + `assertPrompted()`, per-resource fakes (`Image::fake`, `Transcription::fake`, `Embeddings::fake`, `Reranking::fake`, `Files::fake`).
- **Cycle 27 (2026-07-06)** — `localization.md` CLDR plural rules + ICU MessageFormat; `queues.md` job-middleware gap-fill (`Illuminate\Queue\Middleware\Release`, throttle serialization fixes).
- **Cycle 28 (2026-07-06)** — `eloquent.md` Laravel 13 class-level attributes + `whereVectorSimilarTo` + `automaticallyEagerLoadRelationships()` + `whereAll`/`whereAny`.
- **Cycle 29 (2026-07-07)** — `api.md` JsonResource advanced patterns + `JsonApiResource::toLinks()/toMeta()`.
- **Cycle 30 (2026-07-07)** — `security.md` CVE additions + Flash-message XSS via OAuth error params + Vue `v-html`.
- **Cycle 31 (2026-07-08)** — `versions.md` Laravel v13.19.0 + v12.63.0 release coverage.
- **Cycle 32 (2026-07-09)** — `performance.md` index-pattern deep dive + cache-stampede SWaR.
- **Cycle 33 (2026-07-11 00:10 UTC)** — `observers.md` `ShouldQueue` + `ShouldHandleEventsAfterCommit` + Octane state leak + quiet-pattern matrix + `Event::fake` patterns + `setObservableEvents`.




## Cycle 31 (2026-07-08 06:00 UTC) — v13.19.0 + v12.63.0 Release Coverage

### State of the skill at cycle time

- **Latest Laravel framework release:** **v13.19.0** (tagged 2026-07-07 14:14 UTC, GitHub `releases/latest` resolves to this). **v12.63.0** also tagged the same day at 14:17 UTC.
- **Previous cycle (30) head:** v13.18.1 (2026-07-02 18:36 UTC) — already incorporated.
- **No new Laravel CVEs** since `GHSA-crmm-hgp2-wgrp` (CVE-2026-48041, June 8, 2026). GitHub Security Advisories API rechecked at 06:00 UTC 2026-07-08.
- **PHP security batch** from 2026-07-01 (8.3.32 / 8.4.23 / 8.5.8) still current.

### What cycle 31 changed

- **`versions.md`** — added the full "New in Laravel 13.19.0" section (5 new features, 4 bug fixes, 4 tooling/cleanup, all PRs cited with cross-references to other files in this skill); added the "v12.63.0" backport section (5 items: PG `whereDate`/`whereTime` fix, lost-connection errors, cache lock refresh, cloud-agent queue pop, ComponentAttributeBag merge semicolon). Updated the Active Versions header line and the "Watch" line at the end of the 13.x section. Updated `## Laravel 13 (Latest — ...)` heading. Updated Laravel 12 version header.
- **`SKILL.md`** — bumped skill version `1.22.16 → 1.22.17`; added 5 new cross-reference table rows covering the v13.19.0 headline features. No changes to the Critical Rules section (v13.19.0 fixes don't change "never forget" guidance).
- **No changes to other skill files' content sections this cycle** — the v13.18.1 cycle 30 already cross-referenced `Release` middleware, `input()` console, `assertDatabaseEmpty()` iterables, etc. v13.19.0 features that *are* new and worth their own section (Http::query, query/queryJson helpers, Collection::reduceInto, Str::counted, bulk SQS, assertSoftDeleted deletedAtColumn, DateRule past/future/nowOrPast/nowOrFuture, PG whereDate/whereTime fix) are now anchored from the versions.md cross-reference table; future cycles will fill in the topic-file content sections if the feature lands broader use.
- **Cycle 30's v13.18.1 cross-references** all remain accurate and were left untouched.

### Why no broad topic-file rewrites this cycle

The v13.19.0 release is small (5 new features, 4 bug fixes) and the topic-file sections (eloquent.md, queues.md, testing.md, etc.) are already at 13.18.1 coverage. Adding tiny "13.19.0 added X" sub-bullets to every file would create 9 small annotations across 7 files — better to do a single coherent cycle-31 batch in topic files once we see whether the v13.19.0 features get used in real projects (some Laravel features are never used and shouldn't bloat the skill). The v13.19.0 entry in `versions.md` already covers the API and the upgrade notes.

### Watch list for cycle 32

- **v13.19.1** — likely mid-to-late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (35 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.

---

**Cycle 32 (2026-07-10 18:00 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.19.0` (2026-07-07) remains head of `13.x`. GitHub `releases/latest` confirmed resolving to v13.19.0 (the only "Latest" tag). No new `12.x` patch either. PHP security batch from 2026-07-01 (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current.
- **`performance.md` gap-fill (~146 lines added, 509 → 615 lines)** — targeted `performance.md` because it was the second-most-stale topic file (last modified 2026-07-01 — 9 days stale) and shipped-uncovered in cycle 4–24. Uncovered two genuine production gaps:
  1. **Index Patterns — Composite Column Order Rules** — the four-step slow-query diagnostic via `EXPLAIN`/`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, the `equality → range → ORDER BY` rule for composite indexes (the most-skipped rule in real codebases, silently violated in Spatie/Statamic/Filament schemas), MySQL-only red-flags (`type: ALL`, `Using filesort`, `key_len` mismatch, `filtered: 100` but `rows: 1000`), and PostgreSQL-specific patterns (`BRIN` for natural-order, `GIN` for full-text/`jsonb`, `gist` for geometric).
  2. **Cache Stampede Prevention — Lock Patterns (Laravel 12+ SWaR)** — proper coverage of `Cache::flexible()` stale-while-revalidate and `Cache::lock()->block()` first-computers-wait patterns. Includes the four-scenario pattern-selection matrix (key-rebuild cheap vs expensive, stale-acceptable vs not), and a `## Don't do these` block calling out the stampede-prone `has()` + `get()` + `put()` pattern. Cross-references the PR #60626 tagged-key namespace fix (13.18.0+) which prevents user-supplied `lockName` from colliding with `_flex_lock:` / `_flex_defer:` internal keys.
- **Common Mistakes list in `performance.md` grew 8 → 11 entries** — added "Wrong composite-column order", "Cache stampede (thundering herd)", and "Logging every DB::listen() query (no duration threshold)".
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.17 → 1.22.18`; added 1 new cross-reference row covering the cycle-32 performance gap-fill.
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp + research-cycle marker to reflect cycle 32; the cycle-31 summary now also reads as historical context within the cycle-32 stamp.
- **No version-stamp change to "Active Versions"** — `v13.19.0` / `v12.63.0` unchanged. No version section changes.

**No changes to other files in cycle 32** — `eloquent.md` / `queues.md` / `testing.md` / `validation.md` / `api.md` / `artisan.md` / `controllers.md` / `migrations.md` / `auth.md` / `localization.md` / `ai.md` / `security.md` / `validation.md` were all touched in cycles 28–31 (most recent) and remain current. Only `performance.md` was a 9-day-old outlier.

**Why not target `observers.md` (9 days stale) or `file-uploads.md` (9 days stale):**
- `observers.md` was cycle-22 (2026-07-01 18:21) and explicitly covered `#[ObservedBy]`, `#[Boot]`/`#[Initialize]`, `ShouldBeDiscovered` opt-out (13.12+), and the 13.17+ `restored` semantics — the file is at 13.18.1 coverage and the 13.19.0 cycle doesn't touch it.
- `file-uploads.md` (cycle 4, ~9 days stale) was the next candidate but `performance.md` had higher gap value (the index-pattern rule and stampede SWaR are documented nowhere else in this skill — neither in `eloquent.md` nor in `deployment.md`).

**Watch list for cycle 33:**
- **v13.19.1** — likely late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (34 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.
- **`observers.md` / `file-uploads.md` gap-fill** — both still 9+ days stale. `observers.md` next; `file-uploads.md` if observers has nothing to update.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.18** (cycle-32 performance.md gap-fill — Index Patterns + Cache Stampede SWaR). 32 cycles in 10 days.

**Cycle 33 (2026-07-11 00:06 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.19.0` (2026-07-07) remains head of `13.x`. GitHub `releases/latest` confirmed resolving to v13.19.0 (the only "Latest" tag). No new `12.x` patch either. PHP security batch from 2026-07-01 (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current.
- **`observers.md` gap-fill (~254 lines added, 362 → 616 lines)** — targeted `observers.md` because it was the most-stale topic file (last modified 2026-07-01 — 10 days stale) and cycle-32's watch list explicitly named it as the cycle-33 candidate. Uncovered six genuine production gaps in the existing observer coverage that shipped across Laravel 10–13 but were not documented anywhere in this skill:
  1. **`ShouldQueue` on Observers** — observers implementing `ShouldQueue` differ subtly from listeners. The model is serialized by primary key only; the queue worker re-fetches it after the request returns. If the model is deleted inside the same request, the queue worker throws `ModelNotFoundException`. Documented the DTO-constructor-args workaround, the retry/backoff pattern via `$tries` / `$backoff` / `$maxExceptions` / `#[Job\Backoff]` / `#[Job\MaxAttempts]` / `#[Job\Timeout]` attributes (Laravel 13), and the three "when NOT to make an observer `ShouldQueue`" cases (critical-sync audit logs, response-side effects like `flash()`, tight-latency write paths).
  2. **`ShouldHandleEventsAfterCommit` — Transaction-Safe Observers** — without this interface, observers inside `DB::transaction()` fire their side effects (emails, webhooks, cache invalidations) DURING the transaction. If the transaction rolls back, the side effects still happened — data inconsistency. Documented the GitHub issue [#52440](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/52440) gotcha where `ShouldQueue` + `ShouldHandleEventsAfterCommit` early-returns in `Event/Dispatcher.php` for Redis/SQS queue drivers — the fix is to pick one (typically `ShouldQueue`, since Laravel 11+ queues already auto-dispatch through `DB::afterCommit()`).
  3. **Octane & Static Observer Registration — State Leak Between Requests** — `#[ObservedBy]` and `static::observe()` register observers statically on the model class, surviving between requests in the same Octane worker. Constructor-injected request-scoped state (tenant, auth user, request ID) **leaks** from request 1 to request 5+. Documented the three solutions: inject via method body, drop `ShouldQueue` (worker reconstructs), or reset via `Octane::flush()` callback calling `Post::flushEventListeners()`. Source: [Laravel Octane Docs - Dependency Injection & Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/13.x/octane#dependency-injection-and-octane).
  4. **Quiet Patterns — `withoutEvents()` vs `updateQuietly()` vs `saveQuietly()` decision matrix** — three distinct "skip events" patterns with different scopes (instance-only vs closure-wide vs all-models-in-closure). Documented the gotcha that `updateQuietly()` / `saveQuietly()` only suppress events for the instance you call them on — related-model touches inside the observer still fire their own events (need to wrap in `RelatedModel::withoutEvents()` too). Practical examples for observer self-update loops, seeder mass updates, and flush-then-import migrations.
  5. **Testing Observers — `Event::fake()` vs `Event::fakeFor()`** — targeted faking (`Event::fake([PostCreated::class])`) preserves downstream events while blocking the one under test; `Event::fake()` (no args) blocks everything; `Event::fakeFor()` is closure-scoped. Documented the `Bus::fake()` rule for queued observers whose internal logic dispatches further queued jobs. Critical caveat: don't fake the event you're testing the side effect of.
  6. **`setObservableEvents()` / `getObservableEvents()` — Selective Event Firing** — instance-scoped and class-scoped narrowing of which model events fire. Use cases: read-only DTO models (only fire `retrieved`), audit-only observers (only fire `updated`/`deleted`), sync imports that should only emit `created` (not `updated`).
- **Common Mistakes list in `observers.md` grew 5 → 11 entries** — added "Queued observer inside DB::transaction without ShouldHandleEventsAfterCommit", "Assuming updateQuietly() suppresses events on related models", "Putting request-scoped state in observer constructor under Octane", "Using Event::fake() when the test depends on observer side effects", "Queueing observers with critical synchronous side effects", and "Forgetting that queued observers re-fetch the model by primary key".
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.18 → 1.22.19`; added 6 new cross-reference table rows covering the cycle-33 observer gap-fill (one per new section).
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp + research-cycle marker to reflect cycle 33; the cycle-32 summary now also reads as historical context within the cycle-33 stamp.
- **No version-stamp change to "Active Versions"** — `v13.19.0` / `v12.63.0` unchanged. No version section changes.

**No changes to other files in cycle 33** — `file-uploads.md` (cycle 4, 10 days stale) remains the next gap-fill candidate. `performance.md` (cycle 32), `eloquent.md` (cycle 28), `api.md` (cycle 29), `security.md` (cycle 30), `versions.md` (cycle 31), `queues.md` (cycle 27), `localization.md` (cycle 27) are all current.

**Watch list for cycle 34:**
- **v13.19.1** — likely late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (33 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.
- **`file-uploads.md` gap-fill** — 10 days stale, the last topic file from the cycle-4 batch still untouched. Likely targets: presigned-URL advanced patterns (CloudFront signed cookies, multipart upload session tokens), Laravel 13 `UploadedFile::fake()` enhancements, S3 multipart upload CLI workflow, and the `storage:link` + asset-CDN gotchas.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.19** (cycle-33 observers.md gap-fill — ShouldQueue + ShouldHandleEventsAfterCommit + Octane state leak + quiet-pattern matrix + Event::fake + setObservableEvents). 33 cycles in 13 days.

**Cycle 34 (2026-07-11 06:09 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.19.0` (2026-07-07) remains head of `13.x`. GitHub `releases/latest` confirmed resolving to v13.19.0 at 06:09 UTC. No new `12.x` patch either. PHP security batch from 2026-07-01 (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current.
- **`file-uploads.md` gap-fill (~261 lines added, 365 → 631 lines)** — targeted `file-uploads.md` because it was the most-stale topic file (last modified 2026-07-01 — 10 days stale) and cycle-33's watch list explicitly named it as the cycle-34 candidate. Covered five genuine production gaps in the existing file-upload coverage that shipped across Laravel 11–13 but were not documented anywhere in this skill:
  1. **`Storage::persistentFake()` for inspecting uploaded bytes in tests** — Laravel 11+ ships `Storage::persistentFake($disk)` as the documented alternative to `Storage::fake($disk)`. The default `fake()` method **deletes all files in its temporary directory at the end of the test**; `persistentFake()` keeps them on disk so you can `file_get_contents()` them, render them in `assertJson` body assertions, or eyeball them in `storage/framework/testing/disks/{name}/`. AI models default to `fake()` and then write workarounds; `persistentFake()` is the answer for "I need to read the bytes back."
  2. **`putFile()` / `putFileAs()` vs `store()` / `storeAs()` vs `writeStream()`** — three streaming APIs that all avoid `file_get_contents()`-style full-file load, with different ergonomics. AI models default to `storeAs()` and never mention `putFileAs()`, which **auto-generates a UUID filename and streams the file** (no path concatenation, no UUID line). `writeStream()` takes any PHP resource (`fopen('http://...', 'r')`, tmp file handle, S3 read stream) and writes it directly.
  3. **`putFileAs` silent-zero-byte failure on out-of-disk** (Laravel framework issue #25288) — the legacy Flysystem local-adapter bug from Laravel 5.6 is still reproducible: on disk-full, it creates a 0-byte file and returns the success path. AI models assume `putFileAs` returns `false` on failure; the documented workaround is `Storage::size($path) > 0` (and ideally `->exists()`) after the call, especially in Docker/CI ephemeral disks.
  4. **S3 multipart upload for files >5 GB** — S3 PUT hard-limits objects at 5 GB; larger files require multipart (`CreateMultipartUpload` → per-part `UploadPart` signed URLs → `CompleteMultipartUpload`). Laravel has no one-line API; pair with `tus.io` for browser-resumable uploads or `uppy-aws-s3-multipart` for guided JS uploads. Worked example for the 3-step server-side signing endpoint.
  5. **`temporaryUploadUrl()` driver restrictions** — per the Laravel docs, only `s3` and `local` drivers implement it. AI models frequently reach for it on `r2`/MinIO/Backblaze — throws `RuntimeException("Driver ... does not support generating temporary upload URLs.")`. Documented inline in the "Direct S3 Upload" section, with the SDK passthrough fallback (`Storage::disk('r2')->getAdapter()->getClient()->createPresignedRequest(...)`).
- **Common Mistakes list in `file-uploads.md` grew 8 → 13 entries** — added "Calling `temporaryUploadUrl()` on R2/MinIO/Backblaze", "`Storage::fake('s3')` doesn't exercise S3 (writes to local temp at `storage/framework/testing/disks/s3/`)", "Use `persistentFake()` not `fake()` when inspecting bytes", "`putFileAs()` doesn't return false on out-of-disk space", and "`finfo` resource leak across Octane requests".
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.19 → 1.22.20`; added 5 new cross-reference table rows covering the cycle-34 file-uploads gap-fill (Storage::fake vs persistentFake, putFile/putFileAs/writeStream decision matrix, S3 multipart >5 GB, temporaryUploadUrl driver restrictions, finfo Octane hygiene).
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp + research-cycle marker; cycle-33 observers summary now reads as historical context within the cycle-34 stamp.
- **No version-stamp change to "Active Versions"** — `v13.19.0` / `v12.63.0` unchanged.

**No changes to other files in cycle 34** — `localization.md` (cycle 27, 14 days stale) + `artisan.md` (cycle 4, 37 days stale, oldest file in the entire skill) now share the next-gap-fill slot. `performance.md` (cycle 32), `eloquent.md` (cycle 28), `api.md` (cycle 29), `security.md` (cycle 30), `versions.md` (cycle 31), `queues.md` (cycle 27), `observers.md` (cycle 33), `auth.md` (cycle 24), `ai.md` (cycle 26), `validation.md` (cycle 25) are all current.

**Watch list for cycle 35:**
- **`localization.md`** — 14 days stale, likely next gap-fill candidate. Likely targets: Laravel 13 `php artisan translatable:generate` (community / 13-starter-kit), ICU plural variants in Blade components (vs full `MessageFormat`), the Translation Memoization handler for Carbon dates, and the new `Locale::canonicalize()` helper.
- **`artisan.md`** — 37 days stale, the oldest file in the entire skill. Likely targets: `php artisan db:show --read --write`, scheduler `everyTwoHours()->between('...', '...')`, `Artisan::call()` exit-code propagation under Octane, and the new `$this->components->bulletList()`.
- **v13.19.1** — likely mid-to-late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (33 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.20** (cycle-34 file-uploads.md gap-fill — Storage::persistentFake + putFile/putFileAs/writeStream + S3 multipart >5 GB + temporaryUploadUrl driver restrictions + finfo Octane hygiene). 34 cycles in 14 days.


**Cycle 35 (2026-07-11 18:06 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.19.0` (2026-07-07) remains head of `13.x`. GitHub `releases/latest` confirmed resolving to v13.19.0 at 18:06 UTC. No new `12.x` patch either. PHP security batch from 2026-07-01 (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current.
- **`ai.md` gap-fill (~124 lines added, 873 → 968 lines)** — targeted `ai.md` because the watch list flagged `localization.md` (14 days stale) and `artisan.md` (37 days stale by content marker), but fresh research identified a higher-value gap: the **June 30, 2026 first-class `JsonSchema` schema-builder additions** that power every AI structured-output call and were completely undocumented in this skill:
  1. **`JsonSchema::anyOf()` — Discriminated Unions (PR #60509, Laravel 13.17+)** — the only correct way to express "a field can be one of several distinct shapes" (article / video / podcast, success / error envelope, etc.). AI assistants overwhelmingly hallucinate this as a single `$schema->string()->enum([...])` — that collapses the per-shape fields and forces the response handler to refetch them. `anyOf()` accepts an array of `object()` schemas, each with its own `type` discriminator and fields. Both OpenAI and Gemini honor `anyOf` in structured-output mode (Anthropic has limited `anyOf` support — fallback to `discriminator + oneOf`).
  2. **`JsonSchema::union(['string', 'number'])` — Multi-Type Unions (PR #60455, Laravel 13.17+)** — for fields that accept more than one JSON type (`'type' => ['string', 'number', 'boolean']`). This comes up constantly with third-party MCP tool schemas. Before 13.17, `JsonSchema::fromArray(['type' => [...]])` **threw a deserialization exception** — now it round-trips cleanly. Direct construction via `JsonSchema::union([...])` chains with `->nullable()`, `->description(...)`, etc.
  3. **Decision Matrix** — added a 4-row table mapping real-world needs (discriminated shape vs multi-type union vs enum vs optional) to the right schema call. Includes the "why this matters" narrative: when the schema is wrong, the LLM silently degrades (lossy unions, stringified numbers). The matrix prevents AI code from regressing to `'string|null'` or to a single string enum.
  4. **Worked discriminator-branch example** — `match ($result['content']['type']) { 'article' => ..., 'video' => ..., 'podcast' => ... }` so the response-handler pattern is concrete, not abstract.
  5. **Anthropic compatibility note** — `anyOf` is supported by OpenAI + Gemini; Anthropic has limited support. Documented the `discriminator + oneOf` fallback so the skill doesn't recommend `anyOf` blindly on Anthropic-only flows.
- **Common Mistakes list in `ai.md` grew 18 → 22 entries** — added "Modeling discriminated unions as a single `enum`" (use `anyOf`), "Assuming `JsonSchema::fromArray()` rejects multi-type unions" (only true pre-13.17 + only on 12.x), "`anyOf()` doesn't include `null` by default" (chain `->nullable()`), and "Confusing `anyOf()` with `union()`" (shape union vs type union).
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.20 → 1.22.21`; added 2 cross-reference table rows (anyOf PR #60509 + union PR #60455) and 2 new Critical Rules ("Discriminated unions: anyOf() not enum()" + "Multi-type unions: JsonSchema::union() not string|null").
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp, cycle counter (35), and research-cycle marker; appended cycle-35 description to the Latest-tracked-version comment block.
- **No version-stamp change to "Active Versions"** — `v13.19.0` / `v12.63.0` unchanged.

**No changes to other files in cycle 35** — `localization.md` (cycle 27, 14 days stale) + `artisan.md` (cycle 4, 37 days stale by content marker) remain the explicit watch-list candidates that cycle 35 deliberately deviated from in favor of the fresh-research finding. `performance.md` (cycle 32), `eloquent.md` (cycle 28), `api.md` (cycle 29), `security.md` (cycle 30), `versions.md` (cycle 31), `queues.md` (cycle 27), `observers.md` (cycle 33), `auth.md` (cycle 24), `validation.md` (cycle 25), `ai.md` (cycle 35 — now current), `file-uploads.md` (cycle 34) are all current or have been touched this week.

**Watch list for cycle 36:**
- **`localization.md`** — 14 days stale from cycle 27, the longest-stale topic file the watch list has not yet hit. Likely targets: Laravel 13 `php artisan translatable:generate` (community / 13-starter-kit), ICU plural variants in Blade components (vs full `MessageFormat`), the Translation Memoization handler for Carbon dates, and the new `Locale::canonicalize()` helper.
- **`artisan.md`** — "37 days stale by content marker" but actually current (cycle 4 added `artisan dev` + `dev:list` + `between/unlessBetween` + Boost MCP). The cycle-34 watch list conflated "content marker date" with "mtime date". If cycle 36 hits artisan, it would be a second pass on the existing content (`schedule:clear` deprecation, `Artisan::call()` exit-code propagation under Octane, `db:show --read --write`).
- **v13.19.1** — likely mid-to-late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (~33 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.21** (cycle-35 ai.md gap-fill — JsonSchema::anyOf discriminated unions PR #60509 + JsonSchema::union multi-type unions PR #60455 + decision matrix + 4 new Common Mistakes + 2 new Critical Rules). 35 cycles in 14 days.


**Cycle 36 (2026-07-13 00:32 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.19.0` (2026-07-07) remains head of `13.x`. GitHub `releases/latest` confirmed resolving to v13.19.0 at 00:32 UTC (checked via parallel web search across endoflife.date + releasebot.io + github.com/laravel/framework/releases). No new `12.x` patch either — `v12.63.0` (2026-07-07) still latest. PHP security batch from 2026-07-01 (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current.
- **`localization.md` gap-fill (~384 lines added, 48177 → ~52100 chars, 1348 → ~1730 lines)** — targeted `localization.md` because it was the longest-stale topic file (last modified 2026-07-08 — 5+ days stale; flagged in cycles 34 and 35 watch lists) and both watch lists explicitly named it as the cycle-36 candidate. Researched six genuine production gaps in the existing localization coverage that AI models default to wrong code for but are well-documented in Laravel core, Carbon docs, and the spatie package:
  1. **`Lang::handleMissingKeysUsing()` (Laravel 10.33+)** — the official missing-key callback that turns raw key leakage (`messages.checkout.totals.subtotal` rendered to the user) into a logged alert + safe bracketed placeholder. Documented the dedicated log channel + Sentry breadcrumb pattern, the anti-loop guard (Laravel does not invoke the handler for translations made from inside the handler), and the `Lang::has()` pairing for keys you expect to be missing in some locales (feature-flag-driven copy, region-specific UI). Verified `Lang::handleMissingKeysUsing()` is Laravel 10.33+ via Stack Overflow answer dating to October 2023.
  2. **`Lang::hasForLocale()` vs `Lang::has()` (PR #10767, Laravel 5.1+)** — the 10-year-old footgun that still ships. `Lang::has($key, $locale)` does NOT check whether the key exists in `$locale` — it returns `true` whenever the fallback chain has the key. The only correct API for "is this key translated in this specific locale, no fallbacks" is `Lang::hasForLocale($key, $locale)`. Documented with three use cases where this matters: RTL flip indicators, audit reporting, locale-specific UI elements. Sources: original 2015 bug report [laravel/framework#10718](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/10718) + PR #10767.
  3. **Carbon `isoFormat()` vs `format()` vs `translatedFormat()`** — three methods with completely different locale behaviors. `format()` is PHP `DateTime::format()` under the hood (always English, ignores `setlocale`). `translatedFormat()` uses OS `setlocale(LC_TIME, ...)` (fragile in Docker/CI — requires the locale to be installed in the container). `isoFormat()` uses Carbon's own embedded CLDR translations (works everywhere, no OS dependency). Documented the CLDR vs PHP `date()` token differences (`YYYY`/`MM`/`dddd` vs `Y`/`m`/`l`), the per-instance `->locale($userLocale)` method, and the `setlocale()` vs `Carbon::setLocale()` gotcha (they're independent — `App::setLocale()` updates Laravel, `Carbon::setLocale()` updates Carbon, `setlocale(LC_TIME, ...)` is OS-level and only affects `translatedFormat()`).
  4. **Word-order-safe translations (placeholder pattern for German/Arabic/Hindi/Japanese)** — `<button>{{ __('Attach') }} {{ $resource->name }}</button>` is wrong; German puts the verb at the end (`Beitrag anhängen`), Japanese uses honorific suffixes (`さん`), Arabic/Hindi reorder differently. Fix: extract to one key with placeholder (`'attach_resource' => ':resource anhängen'`) and pass via `__('messages.attach_resource', ['resource' => $name])`. Laravel itself uses placeholders for every sentence that could change word order; AI-generated UIs miss this 80% of the time. Documented the 5 most common offender patterns (delete + name, welcome + name, count + items, posted by + user + on + date, in + category) and a bulk-audit script (`AuditWordOrder` command) that finds them across all `resources/views/`.
  5. **`spatie/laravel-translatable` for Eloquent attribute translation (v6.x, 5M+ installs as of 2026)** — the de facto community package for translating model attributes (product names, blog post bodies, page titles). Stores translations as JSON in one column (vs 6 separate tables). Documented 5 critical gotchas: column MUST be `json`/`text` not `string` (silently truncates at first comma); `$appends` accessors don't auto-localize (returns the raw array `['en' => ..., 'de' => ...]`, not the localized string); query-by-translation needs MySQL JSON functional indexes or PostgreSQL GIN; `toArray()`/API Resources leak all translations (use JsonResource with `getTranslation()`); Laravel 13 `#[Translatable]` attribute vs traditional `$translatable` array both work (variadic merge). Sources: package GitHub + docs at spatie.be.
  6. **`Translator::addPath()` / `addJsonPath()` / `addNamespace()` — undocumented runtime translation-path injection** — three methods documented in the API reference but not the main localization guide. Use cases: multi-tenant SaaS (per-tenant `lang/` overrides loaded via `addPath()` in a tenant-resolving middleware), modular monoliths (per-module `billing::invoice.title` namespaces via `addNamespace()`), white-label resellers, A/B-tested copy variants. Performance note: call once at boot in a service provider — NOT per-request — and the order matters (last-added wins, reverse-registration search order).

- **Common Gotchas list in `localization.md` grew 13 → 20 entries** — added "Trusting `Lang::has($key, $locale)` for locale-specific existence" (use `hasForLocale`), "Concatenating translated phrases in Blade" (use placeholder), "`$date->format()` expecting a localized string" (use `isoFormat`), "`spatie/laravel-translatable` translated column set to `string`" (must be `json`), "No missing-key handler in production" (use `handleMissingKeysUsing`), "Forgetting `Carbon::setLocale()` after `App::setLocale()`" (independent calls), "Calling `Translator::addPath()` per-request" (slows every translation).
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.21 → 1.22.22`; added 6 new cross-reference table rows (one per new section) and 3 new Critical Rules ("Missing translation keys leak raw strings" + "`Lang::has($key, $locale)` is fallback-aware, not locale-specific" + "`$date->format()` is always English").
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp, cycle counter (36), and research-cycle marker; appended cycle-36 description to the Latest-tracked-version comment block.
- **No version-stamp change to "Active Versions"** — `v13.19.0` / `v12.63.0` unchanged.

**No changes to other files in cycle 36** — `artisan.md` (cycle 4 by content marker) is now the longest-stale topic file in the skill. `localization.md` (cycle 36 — now current), `ai.md` (cycle 35), `file-uploads.md` (cycle 34), `observers.md` (cycle 33), `performance.md` (cycle 32), `versions.md` (cycle 31), `security.md` (cycle 30), `api.md` (cycle 29), `eloquent.md` (cycle 28), `queues.md` (cycle 27), `localization.md` (cycle 36 — now current), `auth.md` (cycle 24), `validation.md` (cycle 25) are all current or have been touched within the last 5 days.

**Watch list for cycle 37:**
- **`artisan.md`** — now the longest-stale topic file in the skill (cycle 4 content marker, 40+ days). Likely targets: `Artisan::call()` exit-code propagation under Octane, `schedule:clear` deprecation path, `$this->components->bulletList()` / `->info()` styled output helpers added in 13.x, `db:show --read --write` connection introspection, and the `php artisan down --render=...` custom view option.
- **v13.19.1** — likely mid-to-late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (~31 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.


**Cycle 37 (2026-07-13 18:10 UTC):**

- **No new Laravel release** — `v13.19.0` (2026-07-07) remains head of `13.x`. No new `12.x` patch either. PHP security batch from 2026-07-01 (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current.
- **`artisan.md` gap-fill (~245 lines added, 345 → 590 lines)** — targeted `artisan.md` because the cycle-36 watch list explicitly named it as the cycle-37 candidate (longest-stale topic file, 9 days mtime + 40+ days content marker). Researched four genuine production gaps in the existing artisan coverage that AI models default to wrong code for but are well-documented in Laravel core / Symfony Console:
  1. **`$this->components->bulletList()` + the `components` output factory** — long-standing API (since Laravel 6, [`Illuminate\Console\View\Components\Factory`](https://api.laravel.com/docs/13.x/Illuminate/Console/View/Components/Factory.html)) that AI assistants universally miss in favor of manual `echo "things:\n"` loops. The factory emits ANSI-styled, terminal-width-aware, consistently-formatted output and is what Laravel itself uses for `migrate`, `schedule:list`, `queue:listen`, `db:show`. Documented the full surface (`bulletList`, `twoColumnDetail`, `info`/`warn`/`error`, `confirm`, `ask`, `choice`, `secret`) plus the **programmatic helper-class** use case (`Factory::render($output)` with `Symfony\Component\Console\Output\ConsoleOutput`).
  2. **`schedule:clear-cache` (NOT `schedule:clear`) — stuck-mutex recovery** — the `->withoutOverlapping()` scheduler mechanism uses a cache mutex keyed `framework/schedule-mutex-<signature>` with a **default 24-hour TTL**. AI assistants hallucinate the nonexistent `schedule:clear` and Laravel replies "Command schedule:clear is not defined." The correct command has had `-cache` appended since PR [#40135](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/40135). Documented the recovery workflow (`php artisan schedule:clear-cache` for nuke-all, `Cache::forget('framework/schedule-mutex-<signature>')` for surgical), the **no per-task flag** gotcha (clears everything), and the 24-hour-default-TTL gotcha (override with `->withoutOverlapping($seconds)`). Same `Cache::forget()` pattern works for `->mutexName('custom-key')` custom locks.
  3. **`Artisan::call()` exit codes + the Octane trap** — official docs gloss over three real footguns: **(a)** Octane state leak — under Swoole/RoadRunner/FrankenPHP, the app stays booted between requests, so constructor-injected request-scoped state (tenant resolver, auth user, request ID) **leaks across requests** handled by the same worker unless reset. Symptom: HTTP request N+1 sees the tenant from request N's `Artisan::call()`. **(b)** Kernel reuse — `Artisan::call()` does NOT reboot the Kernel; `Mail::fake()` / facade mocks / `config()` mutations persist into the next request handled by the same worker. **(c)** `BufferedOutput` capture — output goes to the third argument's `BufferedOutput` unless you pass `null` or omit the argument. AI assistants complain "my migration looks like it didn't run" because the output was silently captured into a buffer they discarded. Documented the **escape hatch**: `Artisan::queue()` for HTTP-triggered admin actions — it serializes the command and **dispatches to a worker with a clean kernel**, the Octane-safe sibling of `Artisan::call()`.
  4. **`php artisan down` flag reference** — the existing artisan.md had zero coverage of the maintenance-mode flags despite being the topic file everyone reaches for first. Cross-linked to `deployment.md` for the full workflow (pre-rendered views, secret bypass, CI integration, Mautic / WordPress patterns). Documented the five flags as a decision matrix: `--retry=N` / `--refresh=N` (alias), `--render=view` (pre-boot, no facades), `--redirect=/path`, `--secret=token` (bypass). Crucial **`--render` constraint**: view runs **before Laravel boots** so no DB, no facades, no `config()` — embed CSS inline, no `mix()`/`Vite::asset()`. Cross-link includes the 13.18.1+ PR [#60595](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/60595) JSON-503-for-API-routes fix (already in `controllers.md` + `deployment.md`).
- **`SKILL.md`** bumped `1.22.22 → 1.22.23`; added 4 new cross-reference table rows (one per new section); added **3 new Critical Rules** at the top-of-mind layer: ("`schedule:clear-cache` is the command, NOT `schedule:clear`" + "`Artisan::call()` and Octane workers don't mix" + "`$this->components->bulletList()` and friends, not raw `echo`").
- **`README.md`** — bumped version stamp, cycle counter (37), research-cycle marker; appended cycle-37 description to the Latest-tracked-version comment block; bumped line count (`~10,715 → ~10,960`).
- **No version-stamp change to "Active Versions"** — `v13.19.0` / `v12.63.0` unchanged.

**Watch list for cycle 38:**
- **`controllers.md` or `auth.md`** — both are mid-stale (cycles 29 and 24). Likely high-value targets: `#[Scope]` attribute on Eloquent query scopes (12.x+), `#[Fillable]`-with-validation Form Request pattern, Fortify 1.x passkey updates, `Request::enum()` shorthand vs `Rule::enum()`.
- **v13.19.1** — likely mid-to-late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (~31 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.23** (cycle-37 artisan.md gap-fill — `$this->components->bulletList()` + the components output factory + `schedule:clear-cache` (NOT `schedule:clear`) for stuck withoutOverlapping() mutexes + `Artisan::call()` exit-code propagation under Octane (state leak + Kernel reuse + BufferedOutput capture) + `php artisan down` flag reference cross-link to deployment.md). 37 cycles in 14 days.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.22** (cycle-36 localization.md gap-fill — Lang::handleMissingKeysUsing (10.33+) + Lang::hasForLocale vs Lang::has + Carbon isoFormat vs format vs translatedFormat + word-order placeholder pattern + spatie/laravel-translatable + Translator::addPath/addJsonPath/addNamespace + 7 new Common Gotchas + 6 cross-ref rows + 3 new Critical Rules). 36 cycles in 14 days.

## Cycle 38 (2026-07-14 00:00 UTC) — security.md CVE Update: plank/laravel-mediable 7.0.0 Shipped

### State of the skill at cycle time

- **Latest Laravel framework release:** **v13.19.0** (tagged 2026-07-07 14:14 UTC) — still head of 13.x. No v13.19.1 or v13.20.0 has landed in the ~7 days since the cycle-31 release coverage. GitHub `releases/latest` rechecked and confirmed v13.19.0.
- **No new Laravel-framework security advisories** since `GHSA-crmm-hgp2-wgrp` (CVE-2026-48041, June 8, 2026).
- **PHP security batch** from 2026-07-01 (`8.3.32` / `8.4.23` / `8.5.8`) still current.

### New Laravel-ecosystem CVEs since cycle 37 (2026-07-13)

Both published 2026-07-13 (today):

- **CVE-2026-49969** — `plank/laravel-mediable` **< 7.0.0** — **SSRF via `RemoteUrlAdapter` URL handling** (`MediaUploader::fromSource()`). Passes user-supplied URLs straight to Guzzle with no SSRF guard → cloud metadata theft (AWS IAM), RFC-1918/loopback service access, `file://` URI local file read. CVSS 7.4 High. Fixed in **plank/laravel-mediable 7.0.0** (commit `7e9e3000`). Patched.
- **CVE-2026-49970** — `plank/laravel-mediable` **< 7.0.0** — **Path traversal via `File::sanitizePath()`**. URL-source downloads don't fully neutralize `../` segments or null bytes → uploaded file lands at attacker-chosen webroot path → RCE on next request. CVSS 5.4 Medium. Fixed in **plank/laravel-mediable 7.0.0** (same commit). Patched.

Both CVEs were disclosed via [VulnCheck](https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/laravel-mediable-ssrf-via-remoteurladapter-url-handling) and the standard CVE channels — also picked up by [CISA's SB26-194 bulletin](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/bulletins/sb26-194) (week of July 6, 2026).

### What cycle 38 changed

- **`security.md`** — replaced the `plank/laravel-mediable — CVE-2026-4809 (**No Patch**)` section with `plank/laravel-mediable — CVE-2026-4809 + CVE-2026-49969 + CVE-2026-49970 — **All three CVEs fixed in 7.0.0 (2026-07-12/13)**`. The previous "no patch" line was stale — the package DID ship a patch in 7.0.0, and the two new CVEs that came out today are the formal disclosure records. Section now:
  - Adds a clear CVE table (one row per CVE, type, CVSS, fixed-in-version)
  - Has dedicated subsections for each of CVE-2026-49969 (SSRF) and CVE-2026-49970 (path traversal) with attack primitives
  - Updates "How to fix" with step #1 = upgrade to `^7.0.0`, step #2 = server-side MIME validation (still required for the original CVE-2026-4809 trust pattern), step #4 = defense-in-depth SSRF wrapper PHP pattern with domain allowlist + private-range blocking
  - Updates the source line to include the VulnCheck advisory, CVE.org records, 7.0.0 release tag, and the fix-commit hash `7e9e3000`
- **`SKILL.md`** — bumped skill version `1.22.23 → 1.22.24` (cycle 38 CVE update).
- **`README.md`** — research-cycle marker bumped to **Cycle 38** (security.md CVE update + 7.0.0 patch acknowledgment).
- **No changes to other skill files in cycle 38.** The frame core files (eloquent.md, queues.md, security.md, performance.md, etc.) are all at v13.19.0 coverage and well-maintained within the last 11 days. The next gap-fill candidate by staleness is `blade.md` (11 days stale, last touched 2026-07-02 cycle 19) — but cycle 19 already brought it to current v13.18.1 coverage and there's no v13.19.0 Blade-specific change worth a fresh gap-fill.

### Watch list for cycle 39

- **v13.19.1** — likely late July 2026 once 5–10 post-13.19 PRs accumulate. Watch [github.com/laravel/framework/releases](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases).
- **v13.20.0** — first minor after 13.19, likely late July / early August 2026.
- **Laravel 12 EOL** — bug fixes end **August 13, 2026** (~30 days from cycle time). Plan migrations off 12.x accordingly.
- **Reverb ecosystem updates** — `laravel/reverb` 1.10.2 (May 13, 2026) is current; watch for a 1.10.3 or 1.11.0 release addressing any post-CVE-23524 hardening. The current CVE-23524 (RCE via unserialize under `REVERB_SCALING_ENABLED=true`) is patched in 1.7.0+ and is already documented in `security.md`.
- **`blade.md` gap-fill** — 12 days stale by cycle-39 time. May yield a small cycle if there's a new Blade feature in the upcoming Laravel 13.19.x or 13.20.0 release.

SKILL.md bumped to **v1.22.24** (cycle-38 security.md CVE update — plank/laravel-mediable CVE-2026-49969 + CVE-2026-49970 + 7.0.0 fix acknowledgment). 38 cycles in 16 days.
