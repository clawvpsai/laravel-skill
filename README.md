## Why This Skill Exists

Most AI coding assistants hallucinate Laravel patterns that are deprecated, version-mismatched, or just wrong in production. This skill is the ground truth — auto-updated, version-aware, and battle-tested from 7+ years of shipping Laravel apps.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Check Laravel version
php artisan --version

# Load SKILL.md first for navigation
# Then dive into the topic you need
```

## 📚 Topics Covered (17 files)

| Topic | File | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Models, relationships, query builder, migrations | `eloquent.md` + `migrations.md` | Any DB work |
| Routing, validation, request lifecycle | `controllers.md` | Building endpoints |
| Sanctum, policies, gates, CSRF | `auth.md` | User auth & permissions |
| Jobs, workers, retries, failed jobs | `queues.md` | Background processing |
| Templates, components, XSS, slots | `blade.md` | Blade/frontend work |
| CLI commands, scheduling, tinker | `artisan.md` | DevOps & maintenance |
| REST APIs, JSON, rate limiting | `api.md` | API development |
| XSS, SQL injection, hardening | `security.md` | Security-critical code |
| Caching, indexing, eager loading | `performance.md` | Optimization |
| AI agents, tools, streaming, embeddings | `ai.md` | AI/LLM integration |
| PHPUnit, factories, feature tests | `testing.md` | Test-driven dev |
| Production deployment, Docker, Octane | `deployment.md` | Going live |
| File uploads, S3, presigned URLs | `file-uploads.md` | Media handling |
| Model lifecycle, observers, events | `observers.md` | Decoupled logic |
| Log channels, structured logging | `logging.md` | Debugging & monitoring |
| Translations, locales, pluralization | `localization.md` | i18n/l10n |
| Validation rules, Form Requests | `validation.md` | Input validation |

---

## ⚠️ Critical Rules (Never Forget)

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `env()` only in config files | Returns null after `config:cache` |
| Always eager load with `with()` | N+1 queries kill performance |
| Use `$fillable` or `$guarded` | Unprotected mass assignment = security hole |
| Use `findOrFail()` over `find()` | Silent nulls are worse than crashes |
| Queue jobs serialize models as IDs | Re-fetch in handler — model may be stale |
| `DB::transaction()` rolls back on exceptions only | `exit`/timeout bypasses it |
| `{!! !!}` skips escaping | XSS vector, use `{{ }}` by default |
| `required` fails on empty string | Use `required|filled` for actual content |

## 📦 Version Support

| Version | Status | PHP | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Laravel 13** | ✅ Latest (v13.17.0, June 23 2026 — still current) | 8.3+ | AI/Boost MCP, Reverb, new attributes, PHP 8.4/8.5 |
| Laravel 12 | Stable | 8.2+ | Bootstrap 5, Vite, per-second rate limiting |
| Laravel 11 | Security fixes | 8.1+ | Cleaner bootstrap, health endpoint |

## 🔄 Auto-Updater

The skill is **auto-updated every 6 hours** via a cron job. The agent decides whether to update based on whether it finds meaningful gaps — no forced updates.

**How it works:**
1. Checks current state of all 18 topic files
2. Identifies weak or outdated areas via web research
3. Checks for new Laravel/dependency releases
4. Updates files with new patterns + source URLs
5. Commits and pushes to `main` branch automatically

**Last research cycle:** 2026-06-28 12:00 UTC (cycle 7) — Laravel 13.17.0 still latest. Found **four** actionable CVEs since cycle 6. Most urgent: three Composer CVEs (**CVE-2026-45793** GitHub token leak, CVSS 7.5; **CVE-2026-40261** + **CVE-2026-40176** Perforce command injection) — fixed in Composer 2.9.8 / 2.2.28 / 1.10.28. Added a new `Updated from Research (2026-06-28, cycle 7)` section to `security.md` with full mitigation playbook, audit commands, and workarounds. Inserted a **step 0 `composer self-update`** into `deployment.md`'s production deploy steps. Also documented **CVE-2026-54244** (Statamic Live Preview authorization bypass, June 26 2026, patch pending). SKILL.md bumped to v1.19.0; ~8,350 lines now. Last content update: 2026-06-28 12:00 UTC (this cycle).
